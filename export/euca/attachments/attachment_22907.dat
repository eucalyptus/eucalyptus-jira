# When enabled and if virt-inspector2 command is available,
# this hook will use it to analyze the root disk of the 
# instance just prior to boting, will save results in an XML
# file in instance directory, and will append the value of
# <product_name> element found in the output to the file that
# gets prepended to data returned for GetConsoleOutput request.
#
# HOW TO USE:
#
# - Place this script into $EUCALYPTUS/etc/eucalyptus/nc-hooks
#   directory on all NCs and make it executable by 'eucalyptus'
# - Install the virt-inspector2 command
