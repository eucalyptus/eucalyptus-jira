This proof-of-concept implementation is much\n\"dumber\" and hardcodes most of that logic in its own code and in the\nfile \"service-images.yml\".\n\nA complete implementation of the unified service image tool feature will\nrequire euca2ools to have a full-featured euimage implementation that\nincludes a dependency solver.  Ideally, the solution could also learn or\ninfer property names, service names, and service worker API versions\nfrom info it obtains from the CLC, but that can also remain on the\nfilesystem if that is too complex or time-consuming to implement.\n\nFixes EUCA-10198, EUCA-10201, and EUCA-10202","files":[{"path":"clc/eucadmin/bin/euca-install-service-image","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/66ba296cefff9bec9c68b5f4a140de17e689b166#diff-0","changeType":"ADDED","linesAdded":32,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/eucadmin/eucadmin/serviceimages/__init__.py","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/66ba296cefff9bec9c68b5f4a140de17e689b166#diff-1","changeType":"ADDED","linesAdded":28,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/eucadmin/eucadmin/serviceimages/installserviceimage.py","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/66ba296cefff9bec9c68b5f4a140de17e689b166#diff-2","changeType":"ADDED","linesAdded":141,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/eucadmin/setup.py","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/66ba296cefff9bec9c68b5f4a140de17e689b166#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"tools/service-images.yml","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/66ba296cefff9bec9c68b5f4a140de17e689b166#diff-4","changeType":"ADDED","linesAdded":16,"linesRemoved":0}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
