Note this is the euca-specific operation to sign a credential (public key),\n    which is later used to access Euare-controlled resources (e.g., IAM server certificate).\n  * setupCredentialMessages method is added to ClusterAllocator.java. For every runInstance request, the method examines if the instance's user-data\n    begins with special keyword that indicates the credential-setup is required for the instance. If the keyword is found, it generates a random RSA\n    pub/pk. The private key is encrypted using a symmetric key, which is encrypted using the NC's public key. The keys and the signature from Euare is\n    concatenated and set to the 'credential' field of VmRunType.\n  * setLoadBalancerListenerSSLCertificate is implemented on ELB\n  * ELB triggers instance-credential transfer by putting the special keyword on user-data.\n  * Cc/nc wsdl and the stubs are updated to add \"credential\" field to RunInstances request.\n  * euca_auth.c is updated to support decryption using symmetric key algorithm.\n  * Nc is updated to add floppy to Linux instances if credential setup is requested. The instance's pubkey, decrypted private key, signature (by Euare),\n    and Euare's pubkey are added to floppy.","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/cloud/VmRunType.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/510ce61ed9cd0afd13ebac225c59ef3d3204a5af#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":18,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/cloud/run/Allocations.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/510ce61ed9cd0afd13ebac225c59ef3d3204a5af#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":212,"linesRemoved":193},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/cloud/run/ClusterAllocator.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/510ce61ed9cd0afd13ebac225c59ef3d3204a5af#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":95,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/vm/VmInstances.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/510ce61ed9cd0afd13ebac225c59ef3d3204a5af#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":19,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/euare-common/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/auth/euare/EuareMessages.groovy","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/510ce61ed9cd0afd13ebac225c59ef3d3204a5af#diff-4","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":16,"linesRemoved":0}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
