EuareQueryPipeline is updated to require only a Version\nparameter as Signature V4 does hot require any query parameters.\n\nHmacCredentials is updated to remove any assumptions about the location\nof values such as the access key identifier and signature method\ndeclaration. HmacLoginModuleSupport is updated to allow specialization\nof various signature version specific tasks.\n\nThe HmacUtils class is moved and expanded to handle signature versions\nand their variants (Signature V4 has a variation that uses query\nparameters)\n\nHmacHandler is updated to delegate signature version specific tasks to\nthe signature variant in use.\n\nQueryTimestampHandler is updated to use HmacUtils as a facade hiding the\ndetails of the signature variant in use.\n\nTokensQueryPipeline is updated to account for Signature V4 credentials\nwhen checking whether to use password authentication (for user console\nfunctionality)\n\nA SignatureHandlerUtils class is added to provide lookup of parameter\nand header values from a MappingHttpRequest.\n\nExisting HMAC login modules are updated to ignore parameters as\nappropriate and to accept multiple values for each parameter when\ncanonicalizing. An Hmacv4LoginModule is added for login with Signature\nV4, this module does not currently validate the region or service and\nhas a special case to allow for AWS Java SDK signatures with an\nincorrect path of '/'.\n\nThe HmacLoginModuleTest is updated with tests for Signature V4, this\nincludes running the AWS provided test kit and a test using a request\ngenerated by the AWS Java SDK version 1.3.26.\n\nA new SecurityHeader enum is added for working with HTTP headers related\nto security and the SecurityParameter enum is updated to support the new\nparameters for the query variant of Signature V4.\n\nTimestamps is updated to support more timestamp formats. Short variants\nof ISO 8601 dates are now accepted and RFC 2616 / HTTP 1.1 can now also\nbe parsed (e.g. from the HTTP 'Date' header)\n\nMappingHttpRequest is updated to support identification of parameters\nthat were from form fields (as opposed to the query string), this is\nnecessary as form field parameters should not be included in the\ncanonical form of the query parameters (they are included as the request\nbody)\n\nA CollectionUtils class is added for any utility methods related to\ncollections. A Strings class is added for utility methods related to\nStrings.","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/tags/FilterSupport.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/101d85ff049bd81475f51c70984a69d12e667e43#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":1},{"path":"clc/modules/euare/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/auth/ws/EuareQueryPipeline.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/101d85ff049bd81475f51c70984a69d12e667e43#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":3,"linesRemoved":1},{"path":"clc/modules/msgs/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/auth/login/HmacCredentials.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/101d85ff049bd81475f51c70984a69d12e667e43#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":55,"linesRemoved":21},{"path":"clc/modules/msgs/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/auth/login/HmacLoginModuleSupport.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/101d85ff049bd81475f51c70984a69d12e667e43#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":23,"linesRemoved":6},{"path":"clc/modules/msgs/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/auth/login/Hmacv1LoginModule.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/101d85ff049bd81475f51c70984a69d12e667e43#diff-4","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":12,"linesRemoved":3}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
