Handling of the database disable in the HostMapStateListener.entryRemoved()\n   synchronously can cause the calling GMS thread to block.  This is not safe.\n   Replace the synchronous call w/ a submission to the existing dbExecutor for\n   this purpose.\n\n2. During merge the condition for identifying the primary partition coordinator\n   was incorrect.  This made it possible for conflicting/incomplete state to\n   occur after two partitioned views merge back together.  The fix is to find\n   the primary partition coordinator and only sync that state to each hoist.\n\nLast, the changeset includes logging which captures and records:\n- all host view state changes\n- system state and cause during failstop\n- system state in non-fatal error paths","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/msgs/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/bootstrap/Hosts.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/3bc24e09a66201b0560077b334fae12ee3a335c1#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":101,"linesRemoved":77}]},{"id":"30757561685dacf56983f701652c0a6bd92aadfb","displayId":"3075756","authorTimestamp":"2013-05-23T17:27:35.000+0000","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/30757561685dacf56983f701652c0a6bd92aadfb","author":{"name":"Ken Edwards","avatar":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2245558?v=4","url":"https://github.com/kedwards3"},"fileCount":1,"merge":true,"message":"EUCA-4952 Hosts join is sometimes mistreated as a partition merge; which subsequently fails with a NullPointerException","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/msgs/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/bootstrap/Hosts.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/30757561685dacf56983f701652c0a6bd92aadfb#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":101,"linesRemoved":77}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
