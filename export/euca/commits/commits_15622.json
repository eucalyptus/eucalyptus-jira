Added DB query logic to support special characters in some Walrus operations\n\nDB logic uses \"enableLike\" criteria on hibernate queries which results in pattern matching behavior when special characters are present in the query elements. This causes incorrect query results for Walrus objects that have key names with special characters. Fixed the bug by adding querying logic to do an exact match for Walrus operations only.","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/msgs/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/entities/EntityWrapper.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0f62b5fddde9c360b17c8707e387c18a443fb370#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":102,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/walrus/src/main/java/edu/ucsb/eucalyptus/cloud/ws/WalrusImageManager.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0f62b5fddde9c360b17c8707e387c18a443fb370#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":28,"linesRemoved":28},{"path":"clc/modules/walrus/src/main/java/edu/ucsb/eucalyptus/cloud/ws/WalrusManager.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0f62b5fddde9c360b17c8707e387c18a443fb370#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":61,"linesRemoved":61}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
