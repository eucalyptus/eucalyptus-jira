This won't remove all lookups\n        but will only perform N lookups where N is the number of node controllers.\n\n    Testing:\n     - Tested with customer's xml files by instrumenting eucanetd.\n     - Also modified customer's xml files to simulate addition of nc to the config\n     -- by adding one ip\n     -- by changing *all* ips of the ncs in the config","files":[{"path":"cluster/handlers.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/ec0cdc2fbc113fba44f5bd478e0636607233e284#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":5,"linesRemoved":2},{"path":"net/eucanetd.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/ec0cdc2fbc113fba44f5bd478e0636607233e284#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":17,"linesRemoved":3},{"path":"net/globalnetwork.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/ec0cdc2fbc113fba44f5bd478e0636607233e284#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":135,"linesRemoved":12},{"path":"net/globalnetwork.h","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/ec0cdc2fbc113fba44f5bd478e0636607233e284#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":19,"linesRemoved":1}]},{"id":"484c3025ca55bfd07845473af648ed4cc87e772c","displayId":"484c302","authorTimestamp":"2015-04-16T17:23:38.000+0000","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/484c3025ca55bfd07845473af648ed4cc87e772c","author":{"name":"Steven Graham","avatar":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1858109?v=4","url":"https://github.com/scragraham"},"fileCount":1,"merge":false,"message":"Fix issue discovered by Coverity for EUCA-10705\n - properly free host_info and gni memory.","files":[{"path":"cluster/handlers.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/484c3025ca55bfd07845473af648ed4cc87e772c#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":4,"linesRemoved":4}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
