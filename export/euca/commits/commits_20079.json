This will decouple the models in the result\n  collection from the original models, breaking updates to elements\n  in the search results. While this could be desirable under some\n  circumstances it should really be done as a separate operation.\n- Had to hard code the healthy/unhealthy options in the pulldown\n  list. The difficulty here is that the binder previously used\n  to pull the values from a collection would not have run yet so\n  the SELECT binder would not be able to find an option to set\n  the menu to. Adam has a fix for this in upstream Brainfood\n  rivets modifications that needs to be merged into euca. The\n  values are hardcoded as a fix for now, which is sufficient.\n- Roll-overs should be done with CSS instead of functions... since\n  you can do it that way and its better to keep cosmetics completely\n  in the CSS if possible (faster, etc.)","files":[{"path":"console/static/js/views/dialogs/scalinggroupmanageinstances.html","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0366fdac47109b5b8dfbf81838f94d79fe23a87e#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":2,"linesRemoved":1},{"path":"console/static/js/views/dialogs/scalinggroupmanageinstances.js","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0366fdac47109b5b8dfbf81838f94d79fe23a87e#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":6,"linesRemoved":5},{"path":"console/static/js/views/searches/generic.js","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0366fdac47109b5b8dfbf81838f94d79fe23a87e#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":2}]},{"id":"b66f9917426e5550d06971963f3c98f2403df325","displayId":"b66f991","authorTimestamp":"2013-07-10T13:00:18.000+0000","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/b66f9917426e5550d06971963f3c98f2403df325","author":{"name":"Jerry Pommer","avatar":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4935580?v=4","url":"https://github.com/jpommer"},"fileCount":3,"merge":true,"message":"Merge branch 'EUCA-5499' into jpommer","files":[{"path":"console/static/js/views/dialogs/scalinggroupmanageinstances.html","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/b66f9917426e5550d06971963f3c98f2403df325#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":6,"linesRemoved":5},{"path":"console/static/js/views/dialogs/scalinggroupmanageinstances.js","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/b66f9917426e5550d06971963f3c98f2403df325#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":4,"linesRemoved":11},{"path":"console/static/js/views/searches/generic.js","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/b66f9917426e5550d06971963f3c98f2403df325#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":2}]},{"id":"bd472d4afb874a5665b16826610a3f050d501cb0","displayId":"bd472d4","authorTimestamp":"2013-06-12T12:49:08.000+0000","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/bd472d4afb874a5665b16826610a3f050d501cb0","author":{"name":"Jerry Pommer","avatar":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/unknown?d=mm","url":"https://github.com"},"fileCount":7,"merge":false,"message":"EUCA-5499, EUCA-5500, EUCA-5501\nRemove Backbone.Relational, implement functions for dialog view without it.","files":[{"path":"console/static/js/models/astag.js","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/bd472d4afb874a5665b16826610a3f050d501cb0#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":2,"linesRemoved":2},{"path":"console/static/js/models/astags.js","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/bd472d4afb874a5665b16826610a3f050d501cb0#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":2,"linesRemoved":2},{"path":"console/static/js/models/scalinggrp.js","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/bd472d4afb874a5665b16826610a3f050d501cb0#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":3,"linesRemoved":35},{"path":"console/static/js/models/scalinginst.js","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/bd472d4afb874a5665b16826610a3f050d501cb0#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":6,"linesRemoved":6},{"path":"console/static/js/views/dialogs/scalinggroupmanageinstances.html","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/bd472d4afb874a5665b16826610a3f050d501cb0#diff-4","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":4,"linesRemoved":2}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
