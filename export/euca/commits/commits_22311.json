I also adjusted the font size\nof unsubmitted search text to match submitted search facet text\nsize.\n\nThe fundamental problem with delayed searches needs further (and\nperhaps extensive) work. When a user performs a search, the javascript\nwalks the entire heirarchy of objects, performing the matching\noperations on each child all the way down. Some searches do not\nmake any sense (ie. searching for text matches on IP addresses)\nbut which ones is something that requires thought.\n\nAdditionally, on a large search set the run time of the search is\ngoing to run too long even if the search is simplified. The search\nroutine needs to be converted into a queue of operations that are\nrun in asynchronous batches so that it does not trigger the \"your\nscript is running too slowly\" error in the browser. This refactoring\nshouldn't be difficult but is non-trivial.","files":[{"path":"console/static/lib/visualsearch-datauri.css","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/9e91a79601ea0ddfb6222a56f8d55a8cce87d606#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":1},{"path":"console/static/lib/visualsearch.js","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/9e91a79601ea0ddfb6222a56f8d55a8cce87d606#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":6,"linesRemoved":0}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
