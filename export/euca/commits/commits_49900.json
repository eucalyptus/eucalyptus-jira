Apparently Perl was cool\n   with this, but Python is not. Either way, the correct way is the latter, being individual command line options.\n\nChanges:\n - Perl -> Python conversion.\n - added deauthorize_migration_keys(bool lock_hyp_sem) to clear the migration keys\n - changed authorize_migration_keys() to no longer take an options argument\n - both functions call euca_execlp() with the correct parameters\n\nTesting:\n - Instance migration testing to verify that instances can still be migrated\n - full qa automated regression test","files":[{"path":"node/handlers.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/86963b4b326c17b7db347d6c694cf31a39b976c9#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":48,"linesRemoved":12},{"path":"node/handlers.h","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/86963b4b326c17b7db347d6c694cf31a39b976c9#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":2,"linesRemoved":1},{"path":"node/handlers_kvm.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/86963b4b326c17b7db347d6c694cf31a39b976c9#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":2,"linesRemoved":2},{"path":"tools/Makefile","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/86963b4b326c17b7db347d6c694cf31a39b976c9#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":1},{"path":"tools/authorize-migration-keys.pl","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/86963b4b326c17b7db347d6c694cf31a39b976c9#diff-4","changeType":"DELETED","linesAdded":0,"linesRemoved":297}]},{"id":"d57956725d0cf49afe699a899b43c66aaf8c4a25","displayId":"d579567","authorTimestamp":"2017-01-05T22:53:40.000+0000","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/d57956725d0cf49afe699a899b43c66aaf8c4a25","author":{"name":"Steven Graham","avatar":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1858109?v=4","url":"https://github.com/scragraham"},"fileCount":3,"merge":false,"message":"EUCA-12883 - Die, Perl, Die - Part 1 - authorize-migration-keys.pl\n\nDescription:\n - Rename script to not have a .py extension","files":[{"path":"tools/Makefile","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/d57956725d0cf49afe699a899b43c66aaf8c4a25#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":2,"linesRemoved":2},{"path":"tools/authorize-migration-keys","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/d57956725d0cf49afe699a899b43c66aaf8c4a25#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":0,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"util/eucalyptus.h","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/d57956725d0cf49afe699a899b43c66aaf8c4a25#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":2,"linesRemoved":2}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
