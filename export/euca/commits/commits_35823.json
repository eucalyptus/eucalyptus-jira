If not registered with the\n             cloud eucanetd spins in this state creating thousands of empty\n             files in /tmp. Also memory allocated to the handlers is not\n             properly free'd before calling malloc again, causing a memory leak.\n             This issue is not specific to running eucanetd on the CLC, it\n             happens whenever eucanetd cannot load the cluster info in EDGE mode\n\nChanges:\n - Added helper function to delete a file if it exists in /tmp.\n - Unlink associated temporary files when init failure occurs.\n - Skip ebt/ipt/ips/ipr initialization if eucanetd cannot determine it's\n   cluster.\n - Call EUCA_FREE on objects that were allocated via malloc.\n\nTesting:\n - Tested running eucanetd on a CLC. Verified that files\n   are not created in /tmp when in this mode, using inotifywait.\n - Ran Valgrind on eucanetd in this mode for several minutes, verified that\n   memory leak is no longer in the code path.","files":[{"path":"net/eucanetd.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/de0539ac9ea736afe9d0f4183ff1b847efdb9e47#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":77,"linesRemoved":39},{"path":"net/ipt_handler.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/de0539ac9ea736afe9d0f4183ff1b847efdb9e47#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":34,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"net/ipt_handler.h","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/de0539ac9ea736afe9d0f4183ff1b847efdb9e47#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":4,"linesRemoved":0}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
