Launch support includes tagging instances with the group name\nand termination of instances includes evaluation of the relevant\ntermination policies. Launch and terminate activities are subject to\nback off on failure and a configuration property is added to disable all\nscaling activities in the cloud.\n\nThe AutoScalingGroup entity is updated to track the current capacity of\neach group and if scaling is currently required for the group.\n\nEntities are added for scaling activities and instances and a new\nActivityManager is added to direct/coordinate scaling activities. The\nActivityManager uses the new BackoffRunner for handling of back off on\nfailures and the new EucalyptusClient for access to the Eucalyptus (EC2)\nservice.\n\nTerminationPolicyType is updated with implementations for each policy. A\nTerminationPolicyTypeTest unit test is added for validation.\n\nA new InternalImpersonationHandler is added and ServiceContext updated\nto support impersonation for remote and local clients respectively (this\nis subject to change)\n\nTagManager is updated to allow creation of tags with restricted names\nfor internal clients.\n\nEUCA-4893","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/autoscaling-common/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/autoscaling/common/AutoScalingMetadata.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/88f1c4267797f7dcde9b255570627865ddd4744b#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":3,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/autoscaling/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/autoscaling/AutoScalingService.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/88f1c4267797f7dcde9b255570627865ddd4744b#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":2,"linesRemoved":1},{"path":"clc/modules/autoscaling/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/autoscaling/activities/ActivityManager.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/88f1c4267797f7dcde9b255570627865ddd4744b#diff-2","changeType":"ADDED","linesAdded":364,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/autoscaling/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/autoscaling/activities/ActivityStatusCode.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/88f1c4267797f7dcde9b255570627865ddd4744b#diff-3","changeType":"ADDED","linesAdded":54,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/autoscaling/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/autoscaling/activities/BackoffRunner.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/88f1c4267797f7dcde9b255570627865ddd4744b#diff-4","changeType":"ADDED","linesAdded":204,"linesRemoved":0}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
