For example, they can choose to never return. Or return abnormally in some other way.  The calling side must address this.  To wit, the support for listeners in the futures now has a timeout.","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/msgs/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/util/concurrent/AbstractListenableFuture.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/2d38b86a9858c4e5874256f92ee26811018ffb89#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":120,"linesRemoved":36}]},{"id":"8528e9677d3def80a2cba06bba8aae458fd2c7b1","displayId":"8528e96","authorTimestamp":"2014-02-08T08:57:48.000+0000","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/8528e9677d3def80a2cba06bba8aae458fd2c7b1","author":{"name":"chris grzegorczyk","avatar":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/985057?v=4","url":"https://github.com/grze"},"fileCount":6,"merge":false,"message":"EUCA-8707, EUCA-7938: Fix CLC coupling between CC/NC DescribeResources\n\nThe ResourceStateCallback for the CC was using the result of\nDescribeResources to seed the tag list of nodes and use it as the\nbasis for updating node information.  Problematically,\nthis was from the thread of control of the ResourceStateCallback.\nTo make matters worse, the \"update\" work involved sending NC# of\nDescribeServices requests.  Should that number be large enough it\nwould quickly exhaust the works on the CC.  Through this path,\nthere existed a feedback loop between the check activity of the NC and\nthe enabling and check activity of the CC.  Because there was no\ncleanup for the NC service configurations they would always lead to\nthis problem after thier first registration given that the timing\nwas right (read: there are enough NCs).","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/cluster/ClusterBuilder.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/8528e9677d3def80a2cba06bba8aae458fd2c7b1#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":28,"linesRemoved":24},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/cluster/callback/ResourceStateCallback.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/8528e9677d3def80a2cba06bba8aae458fd2c7b1#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":18,"linesRemoved":4},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/node/NodeControllerConfigurationBuilder.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/8528e9677d3def80a2cba06bba8aae458fd2c7b1#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":28,"linesRemoved":31},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/node/Nodes.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/8528e9677d3def80a2cba06bba8aae458fd2c7b1#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":240,"linesRemoved":112},{"path":"clc/modules/msgs/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/component/Faults.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/8528e9677d3def80a2cba06bba8aae458fd2c7b1#diff-4","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":12,"linesRemoved":2}]},{"id":"e5403e56c8a3b0a524325d3264bab70c65407c6d","displayId":"e5403e5","authorTimestamp":"2014-02-08T07:44:04.000+0000","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/e5403e56c8a3b0a524325d3264bab70c65407c6d","author":{"name":"chris grzegorczyk","avatar":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/985057?v=4","url":"https://github.com/grze"},"fileCount":1,"merge":false,"message":"EUCA-8707, EUCA-7938: Fix to NodeController partition lookup.\n\nMust use the name of the partition for the lookup.","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/msgs/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/config/ComponentConfiguration.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/e5403e56c8a3b0a524325d3264bab70c65407c6d#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":1}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
