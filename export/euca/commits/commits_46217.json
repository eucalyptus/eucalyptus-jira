The fix is to\n             add a hook script to libvirtd so that the file ownership is changed back to eucalyptus.eucalyptus upon release\n             of the domain.\n\nChanges:\n - Added libvirt-hooks/qemu to be placed in /etc/libvirt/hooks.\n - Changed Makefiles to include libvirthooksdir when installing the node controller code.\n\nTesting:\n - Tested migration and termination of instances, varified that files are properly cleaned up.","files":[{"path":"Makedefs.in","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/519a5ff3e7e0e96c18f03cdd23f161f84fd160e2#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"node/Makefile","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/519a5ff3e7e0e96c18f03cdd23f161f84fd160e2#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":3,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"node/libvirt-hooks/qemu","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/519a5ff3e7e0e96c18f03cdd23f161f84fd160e2#diff-2","changeType":"ADDED","linesAdded":94,"linesRemoved":0}]},{"id":"10a716d195218f7d7ed96ddd32ec652f7e656ec7","displayId":"10a716d","authorTimestamp":"2016-12-03T16:42:36.000+0000","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/10a716d195218f7d7ed96ddd32ec652f7e656ec7","author":{"name":"Matt Bacchi","avatar":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6763301?v=4","url":"https://github.com/mbacchi"},"fileCount":1,"merge":false,"message":"install libvirthooksdir and qemu to DESTDIR\n\naddendum to EUCA-12594","files":[{"path":"node/Makefile","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/10a716d195218f7d7ed96ddd32ec652f7e656ec7#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":2,"linesRemoved":2}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
