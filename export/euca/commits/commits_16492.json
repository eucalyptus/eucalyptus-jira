We also now handle restoration of addresses\nwhen the address is not currently active. In this case the address is\nassigned to the instance as a system address.\n\nIn VmInstance.doUpdate:~1530 there was a duplicated case that has been\nremoved.\n\nFixes EUCA-3833, EUCA-3866, EUCA-3879","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/cluster/callback/VmStateCallback.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/2e9764e7a63ee1342c43d19a7d84ff40093656c4#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":20,"linesRemoved":5},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/vm/VmInstance.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/2e9764e7a63ee1342c43d19a7d84ff40093656c4#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":32,"linesRemoved":21},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/vm/VmInstances.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/2e9764e7a63ee1342c43d19a7d84ff40093656c4#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":5,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/vm/VmRuntimeState.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/2e9764e7a63ee1342c43d19a7d84ff40093656c4#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":7,"linesRemoved":8}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
