Backend specific\nfunctionality was removed from common code prio to relocation, notable\nchanges follow.\n\nThere is a new VmInstanceMetadata class for handling instance meta-data\nrequests, this was moved from VmInstance.\n\nBundling specific code is moved from the VmInstance hierarch to Bundles.\n\nLifecycle and various other code is moved from VmInstance to\nVmInstances.\n\nVolumeUpdateEventListener and SnapshotUpdateEventListener are broken out\nfrom Volumes and Snapshots into top-level classes.\n\nEUCA-10660","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/autoscaling-backend/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/autoscaling/activities/ActivityManager.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0ba1ce569716e381cca50cb82d8336bee4465cf7#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":34,"linesRemoved":18},{"path":"clc/modules/autoscaling-backend/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/autoscaling/activities/ComputeClient.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0ba1ce569716e381cca50cb82d8336bee4465cf7#diff-1","changeType":"ADDED","linesAdded":35,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/autoscaling-backend/src/test/java/com/eucalyptus/autoscaling/activities/ActivityManagerTest.groovy","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0ba1ce569716e381cca50cb82d8336bee4465cf7#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":25,"linesRemoved":16},{"path":"clc/modules/autoscaling-backend/src/test/java/com/eucalyptus/autoscaling/activities/TestClients.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0ba1ce569716e381cca50cb82d8336bee4465cf7#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":23,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/address/AbstractSystemAddressManager.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/0ba1ce569716e381cca50cb82d8336bee4465cf7#diff-4","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":3,"linesRemoved":3}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
