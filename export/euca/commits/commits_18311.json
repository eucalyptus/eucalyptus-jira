Support for signature\nv1 is removed.\n\nX.509 certificate login is updated to locate the principal using the\ncertificate identifier, which is derived from the X.509 certificate.\n\nThe new UserPrincipal interface represents the authenticated principal,\nwhich may be via a role as reflected by the authenticatedId property. A\nEuareUser interface is added which has IAM specific functionality and\nthe existing User interface now exposes only the common ( UserPrincipal,\nEuareUser ) functionality.\n\nThe UserPrincipal exposes the policies to use for authorization with the\nauthenticated identity and the Context is updated to provide the account\nalias and number as properties.\n\nDirect usage of Account for properties such as the alias or the\ncanonical identifier is removed and relaced with lookups via the\nAccounts facade.\n\nRequests using the administrator of an account now simply use the\naccount number (via AccountFullName), resolving the account to a user is\nperformed by the recipient.\n\nAn initial IdentityProvider interface is added which is the federatable\nalternative to the AccountProvider interface. A DatabaseIdentityProvider\nimplementation is added for local identities and these providers are now\nlooked up via service loaders.\n\nEUCA-4587\nEUCA-10449\nEUCA-10567","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/authentication/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/auth/DatabaseAccessKeyProxy.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/f7b87a0407bcda6dd2e4f6c2267bd84c6d0cacf2#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":10,"linesRemoved":7},{"path":"clc/modules/authentication/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/auth/DatabaseAccountProxy.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/f7b87a0407bcda6dd2e4f6c2267bd84c6d0cacf2#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":6,"linesRemoved":5},{"path":"clc/modules/authentication/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/auth/DatabaseAuthBootstrapper.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/f7b87a0407bcda6dd2e4f6c2267bd84c6d0cacf2#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":4,"linesRemoved":5},{"path":"clc/modules/authentication/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/auth/DatabaseAuthProvider.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/f7b87a0407bcda6dd2e4f6c2267bd84c6d0cacf2#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":23,"linesRemoved":7},{"path":"clc/modules/authentication/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/auth/DatabaseCertificateProxy.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/f7b87a0407bcda6dd2e4f6c2267bd84c6d0cacf2#diff-4","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":10,"linesRemoved":10}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
