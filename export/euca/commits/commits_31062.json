This is a temporary change for debugging and will be improved.","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/block-storage/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/blockstorage/BlockStorageController.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/591bca92ad6f4d7ce8999e3aa77cf49508bdce94#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":28,"linesRemoved":3},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/address/Address.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/591bca92ad6f4d7ce8999e3aa77cf49508bdce94#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":9,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/address/AddressManager.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/591bca92ad6f4d7ce8999e3aa77cf49508bdce94#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":5,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/blockstorage/VolumeManager.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/591bca92ad6f4d7ce8999e3aa77cf49508bdce94#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":10,"linesRemoved":2},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/blockstorage/Volumes.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/591bca92ad6f4d7ce8999e3aa77cf49508bdce94#diff-4","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":1}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
