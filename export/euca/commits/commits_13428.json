Improved cleanup for failed Walrus PUT requests.\n\nWalrus PUT request creates a temporary object on the file system, runs checks on this object, and then commits the object.\nMoved up policy and bucket size checks on the temporary object to take place before the final object is written to file system.\nIf one or more of the checks fail, the process errors out graciously after cleaning up the temporary object.\nPreviously existing object with the same key name, if any, is left untouched. Fixed the same issue for PUT inline (SOAP) requests.\nCorrected the object size calculation for the case where its being overwritten.","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/walrus/src/main/java/edu/ucsb/eucalyptus/cloud/ws/WalrusManager.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/6230cc4fa43993e0961f9daa4d24038e0522796c#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":86,"linesRemoved":57}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
