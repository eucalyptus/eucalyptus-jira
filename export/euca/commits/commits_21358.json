This is okay, because when the resource actually does get created, the tags will see the ID change on the model they're watching, and update themselves too. Tags will fail the first time, resource gets saved, ID is returned, tags save themselves again and succeed. Every time. No need to show this error.","files":[{"path":"console/static/js/models/tag.js","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/e96d4ceb6df1527dc5e802db60ad2ec3ee4927af#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":7,"linesRemoved":0}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
