This breaks\nthings when the eucalyptus user must not own some of the files there,\nsuch as when you're using certain storage systems that put snapshots\nor metadata there.\n\nIn this episode of this recurring bug (number 3, if you're keeping\ntrack), we remove a call to this function from euca_upgrade.  This is\nthe last call to this command that I can find in the source tree,\nso hopefully it isn't going to show up again.  Hopefully.\n\nIf you aren't running an install where packaging will take care of\npermissions for you, don't forget to run it if necessary.\n\nFixes EUCA-4277","files":[{"path":"tools/euca_upgrade","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/a8d7a120b5d92ef1da20e3e4016abc13d71d2152#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":5}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
