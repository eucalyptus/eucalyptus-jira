This would normally require one to run\neuca_conf --synckey for each machine running such a service, so we\nstreamline this a bit by adding a new --sync-euca-p12 option that copies\neuca.p12 to all machines (except for the enabled CLC, which this should\nbe running from) that are running at least one of the following four\nservices after an upgrade to eucalyptus 4.0:\n  * bootstrap\n  * storage\n  * vmwarebroker\n  * walrusbackend\n\nThis operation is very selective about what it copies and where it\ncopies to.  It is not intended for use as a debugging tool.\n\nFixes EUCA-9377","files":[{"path":"clc/eucadmin/bin/euca_conf.in","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/d1ebc82007c718bd0044f0f4a04cc219d445ca7f#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":50,"linesRemoved":13}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
