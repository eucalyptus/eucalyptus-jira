Fixes EUCA-5040.\n\nDuring SC startup in OverlayManager it will scan the DB and attempt to re-export any volumes\nthat were exported (had iscsi targets) on last shutdown. The decision is made based on the\npresence of a loopback device name in the DB. The reload process will restore loopbacks,\nassign new ones if the previous is taken by another resource, and ensure that LVM LVs are\nenabled and iSCSI targets reconstructed. If volume is already exported (i.e. just a service\nrestart instead of a machine reboot), then the process cleanly leaves existing resources\nuntouched.\n\nAlso adds many INFO level log messages to track process during startup. Grep for 'SC Reload'\nin the cloud-output.log to see the process.","files":[{"path":"clc/modules/storage-controller/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/storage/OverlayManager.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/5de4249754ea2d4fec62202f4faff322bda88e0f#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":31,"linesRemoved":15}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
