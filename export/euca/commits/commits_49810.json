This condition will cause the NC to drop into a failed state.\n\nChanges:\n - Check to see if the configuration even changed, if not (most likely the case), don't restart libvirtd\n - Check to see if libvirtd comes back up after restarting libvirtd ~20 seconds.\n\nTesting:\n - Tested script by hand to verify functionality.\n - Tested interaction with NC startup to verify that libvirtd is not getting restarted.","files":[{"path":"tools/authorize-migration-keys.pl","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/d951406908e9741006b81b6f32c7f727aee0e452#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":32,"linesRemoved":0}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
