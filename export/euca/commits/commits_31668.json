As a result, the --stop-source\noption to euserv-migrate-instances may not actually stop the node\ncontroller in question, leading to more instances appearing on it when\nit is supposed to be going down for maintenance.  We could potentially\njust enter a loop and keep trying until the service's state does change,\nbut at that point it is probably better done by euserv-modify-service or\nthe cloud administrator him/herself.\n\nSince we're doing a backwards-incompatible change to admin tools anyway,\nthis commit simply removes the --stop-source option.  People seem to\nonly rarely use the migration feature for its intended purpose anyway.\n\nFixes EUCA-9789","files":[{"path":"admin-tools/eucalyptus_admin/commands/ec2/migrateinstances.py","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/bf619d422f0e5d3dbe305bf3b14f00e9d716f9cb#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":18},{"path":"admin-tools/man/euserv-migrate-instances.1","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/bf619d422f0e5d3dbe305bf3b14f00e9d716f9cb#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":2,"linesRemoved":7}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
