Fixes EUCA-7269.\n\nIncludes optimizations for fast-failure for images that will not fit in the cache to\navoid flushing the cache or doing a part assembly if the image will never fit.\n\nAlso includes a new configurable property: cloud.images.maximagesizegb that gives the\nadmin explicit control over the maximum image size that is allowed to be registered. The\ncheck is at registration time and will return an error to the user if the image is too large.\nThe default for new installations is 30GB (same as walrus cache size default) and for upgrade\nthe value is set to 0 (<=0 is treated as unlimited size on registration check).\n\nCommit also includes a lot of logging changes to present the behavior of the cache to the admin.\nLog entries are prefixed with [CorrelationId: <id> | Account: <account> ] for cache requests and\nunbundling/caching tasks are prefixed with [Caching Task: <task thread id>].","files":[{"path":"clc/.classpath","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/72d73e81eed09c6bc57c294ccf5957fcc06544a6#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":218,"linesRemoved":231},{"path":"clc/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.groovy.core.prefs","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/72d73e81eed09c6bc57c294ccf5957fcc06544a6#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":1},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/images/ImageConfiguration.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/72d73e81eed09c6bc57c294ccf5957fcc06544a6#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":64,"linesRemoved":1},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/images/ImageManager.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/72d73e81eed09c6bc57c294ccf5957fcc06544a6#diff-3","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":9,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"clc/modules/cluster-manager/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/images/StaticDiskImages.java","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/72d73e81eed09c6bc57c294ccf5957fcc06544a6#diff-4","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":7,"linesRemoved":1}]},{"id":"d3ecf8b2708272975af658ee2141d604c6616ca8","displayId":"d3ecf8b","authorTimestamp":"2013-09-16T20:24:53.000+0000","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/d3ecf8b2708272975af658ee2141d604c6616ca8","author":{"name":"Zach Hill","avatar":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1696308?v=4","url":"https://github.com/zhill"},"fileCount":1,"merge":false,"message":"Fixed a type in commit for EUCA-7269 fix.
