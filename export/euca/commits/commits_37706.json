When source and destination NC are the same (VMs are hosted by the same NC), filtering occurs before SNAT (and will not match rules referring to public IPs).\nThis fix detects security group rules that refer to public IP addresses of VMs hosted by a NC running eucanetd (EDGE). Additional iptables rules that matches against corresponding VM(s)' private address(es) are placed.\nPrior to this fix, iptables rules were generated using globalNetworkInfo.secgroups[].grouprules[].name (filled when parsing the global_network_info.xml)","files":[{"path":"net/euca_gni.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/86b95ec57edaebf48fcaabe731f609ad74f87a9d#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":115,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"net/euca_gni.h","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/86b95ec57edaebf48fcaabe731f609ad74f87a9d#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"net/eucanetd_edge.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/86b95ec57edaebf48fcaabe731f609ad74f87a9d#diff-2","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":50,"linesRemoved":4}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
