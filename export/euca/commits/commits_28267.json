Eucalyptus 4.0's new service\nseparation violates this assumption, so we deal with this by making each\ninstance in which EC2_URL would be consulted return http://127.0.0.1/\ninstead since we already require registration tools and the like to be\nrun from a CLC.\n\nTo change the endpoint's DNS name, use the -U/--url option, but note\nthat the service path will always be replaced with hardcoded values.\nThis is not a change from previous versions, but if it nonetheless\nbecomes an issue we can revisit it.\n\nFixes EUCA-8937","files":[{"path":"clc/eucadmin/eucadmin/__init__.py.in","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/4567f872c7a50ce7493bb56a18335456aa11f1e3#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":9,"linesRemoved":1}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
