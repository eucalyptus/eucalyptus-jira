The\n   ccInstance secNetCfgs->stateName is empty causing the information to not be included in\n   the request to the node controller.\n\nChanges:\n - CC: Fixed a memcpy() bug where we copy the first secondary netConfig to every network configuration\n   for the instance.\n - CC/NC: Changed adb-helper.h to set the stateName to \"attached\", when unmarshalling the request as\n   the presence of the secondary interfaces indicates that they are attached.\n\nTesting:\n - QA regression.\n - nephoria-vpc-eni-basics tests.\n - Instrumented debugging and packet verification.\n - Verified that the secondary interfaces are correctly owned by midonet.","files":[{"path":"cluster/handlers.c","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/2b882ef00fbbc133762e6d1b38d10afd399d5595#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":1},{"path":"util/adb-helpers.h","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/commit/2b882ef00fbbc133762e6d1b38d10afd399d5595#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":0}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
