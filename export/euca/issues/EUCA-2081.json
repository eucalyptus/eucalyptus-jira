For example, I might use round robin placement mechanism with some load balancers but use weighted round robin or least traffic or longest up time node \r\n4.\tAs a cloud user, I would like my load balancers to have SSL termination at the load balancers but have normal connections to my backend virtual instances or have options to control very similar to AWS client listener configuration so I have flexibility\r\n5.\t As a cloud user, I would like to have configurable parameters for virtual instances timeout, healthy and unhealthy threshold very similar to AWS so I get to control how my load balancers check if virtual instances are healthy or unhealthy and how often do these checks need to be performed\r\n6.\tAs a cloud user, I would like to have a graphical UI very similar to AWS Management Console so I can quickly configure load balancers in a PoC or Dev/Test environments\r\n\r\n\r\nCloud Admin Use Cases:\r\n\r\n  1. As a Cloud Admin, I would like to have a self-service API interface to our F5 load balancer hardware infrastructure so I don't have to go to my networking group to add/remove my private cloud virtual instances as it slows down provisioning time\r\n  2. As a Cloud Administrator, I would like to automatically discover our load balancer by specifying DNS name or ip address of the loadbalancer web services end point and credentials given by our network administrator so I can automatically discover and keep all load balancer information in the private cloud platform for future interactions\r\n  3. As a Cloud Administrator, I would like my IaaS platform to recognize our load balancer cluster (HA) configuration so that I can provide reliable load balancing service to my applications in production\r\n  4. As a Cloud Admin, I would like to allocate a pre-defined load balancer virtual pool to application developers accounts so that I can do capacity planning using the overall usage of my load balancer hardware to forecast future purchases of additional load balancers\r\n  5. As a Cloud Admin, I would like to have a report of how many accounts are using how much of the allocated virtual pool out of my load balancer hardware so that I can set appropriate policies for application developer accounts\r\n\r\nWeb Services/Application Developer Use Cases\r\n\r\n  1. As a web services application developer, I would like to add my virtual instances into a load balancing system so I can protect my application against poor performance during peak workloads\r\n  2. As a web services application developer, I would like to remove my virtual instances from the load balancing system so I can re-use my allocated virtual pool\r\n  3. As a web services application developer, I would like my IaaS platform to have an easy to use API similar to Amazon AWS Elastic Load Balancing so I readily become productive with familiar set of API\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/\r\nUS_SettingUpLoadBalancerHTTP.html](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ElasticLo\r\nadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/US_SettingUpLoadBalancerHTTP.html)\r\n\r\n[http://awsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/elb-\r\nqrc.pdf](http://awsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/elb-\r\nqrc.pdf)\r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.gogrid.com/wiki/index.php/(F5)_Load_Balancer\r\n\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"customfield_11301":null,"customfield_11302":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":59.0,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"ELB: Scope and initial effort to support self-service interface for load balancers","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=agrimm","name":"agrimm","key":"agrimm","accountId":"557058:9ebc3512-73d8-45c9-85de-4325aaa62488","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Andy Grimm","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=admin","name":"admin","key":"admin","accountId":"557058:175c7fa0-3cb8-429c-907a-b13a8fc31781","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/1494fa7182707b4002454aaa788c7154?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/1494fa7182707b4002454aaa788c7154?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/1494fa7182707b4002454aaa788c7154?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/1494fa7182707b4002454aaa788c7154?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Product Management Team","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"customfield_10000":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i01hbj:","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":["Architecture-3.3","Elb3.2"],"customfield_10004":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["admin(admin)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-2081/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
