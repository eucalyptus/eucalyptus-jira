Another way to identify what grantee a bucket/object ACL applies to is a predefined group - which is supported by [Amazon S3|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#specifying-grantee].\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n*Amazon S3 Predefined Groups*\r\n\r\nAmazon S3 has a set of predefined groups. When granting account access to a group, you specify one of our URIs instead of a canonical user ID. We provide the following predefined groups:\r\n\r\n* *Authenticated Users group* – Represented by http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers.\r\nThis group represents all AWS accounts. Access permission to this group allows any AWS account to access the resource. However, all requests must be signed (authenticated).\r\n\r\n* *All Users group* – Represented by http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers.\r\nAccess permission to this group allows anyone to access the resource. The requests can be signed (authenticated) or unsigned (anonymous). Unsigned requests omit the Authentication header in the request.\r\n\r\n* *Log Delivery group* – Represented by http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery.\r\nWRITE permission on a bucket enables this group to write server access logs (see [Server Access Logging|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html]) to the bucket.\r\n\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n*Note*\r\nWhen using ACLs, a grantee can be an AWS account or one of the predefined Amazon S3 groups. However, the grantee cannot be an Identity and Access Management (IAM) user. For more information about AWS users and permissions within IAM, go to [Using AWS Identity and Access Management|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/].\r\n\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n*Note*\r\nWhen you grant other AWS accounts access to your resources, be aware that the AWS accounts can delegate their permissions to users under their accounts. This is known as cross-account access. For information about using cross-account access, go to [Enabling Cross-Account Access in Using Identity and Access Management|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Delegation.html].\r\n{quote}","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Support
