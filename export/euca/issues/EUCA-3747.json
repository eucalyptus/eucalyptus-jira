The following issue was explained by Andy Grimm:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nUnfortunately, this is a continuation of the issues which result from\r\ntrying to preserve artifacts owned by deleted users. To preserve\r\nthem, I create what I call \"phantom\" accounts and users - transient\r\nusers which exist long enough to have related objects migrated. The\r\nproblem is that account names must be unique in the database, so\r\nwhen an account and a user have both been deleted and recreated, what\r\nI ended up doing is attaching both instance of the user to the newer\r\nof the two accounts. Here's the concrete example in a user's database:\r\n\r\nold database:\r\nacct no: 744658945633, acct name: kamphuis,\r\nuser id: I1RUURJHILHW38467OXVJ, user name: kamphuis (this one has been deleted)\r\nacct no: 460920284550, acct name: kamphuis, \r\nuser id: XKJMV9KUVKMDL7TA9BZFT, user name: kamphuis\r\n\r\nnew database:\r\nacct no: 460920284550, acct name: kamphuis, \r\nuser id: I1RUURJHILHW38467OXVJ, user name: kamphuis (phantom: will be deleted after upgrade)\r\nacct no: 460920284550, acct name: kamphuis, \r\nuser id: XKJMV9KUVKMDL7TA9BZFT, user name: kamphuis\r\n\r\nThis causes two problems. First, the data \"preserved\" for the deleted\r\nuser ends up connected to the wrong account. That's not particularly\r\ngood for things like walrus buckets and objects. The second problem\r\nis what causes the upgrade to fail, though, which is that for both of\r\nthese users, the default network group ends up with\r\nmetadata_unique_name of 460920284550:default. The attempt to add the\r\nsecond one causes a constraint violation.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nIs there a possible workaround that can be done to get this issue resolved?","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/attachment/12910","id":"12910","filename":"EUCA-3747.patch","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=agrimm","name":"agrimm","key":"agrimm","accountId":"557058:9ebc3512-73d8-45c9-85de-4325aaa62488","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Andy
