They work the same way the equivalent simplequeue properties did before more recent refactoring.  To use cassandra, set the cassandra_host first (which will connect and create the tables), then change db_to_use to \"cassandra\".  \r\n# A CassandraSessionManager.java class was added, based on the original version in simplequeue.  We ultimately need to consolidate the two \"cassandra_host\" properties in a single location.  (Perhaps the \"cassandra\" service)?  We shouldn't necessarily create the tables during property change because an error in the script may mask a connection error.  We may need to keep the db_to_use property however.  Maybe a different name, as postgres is still used for some other things.\r\n# The table in postgres that was replaced was eucalyptus_billing.aws_usage_hourly.  It was determined that cassandra was not currently needed for \"eucalyptus_billing.billing_monthly_report\" (though it could be added)\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to discuss the cassandra solution for a little bit, describing the fields and queries that needed to be modeled, just to give an example for later use.\r\n\r\nData Model consisted of one entity:  AwsUsageRecord, with the following fields:\r\n* OwnerAccountNumber\r\n* Service\r\n* Operation\r\n* UsageType\r\n* Resource\r\n* StartTime\r\n* EndTime\r\n* UsageValue\r\n\r\nAll fields are Strings/Text values, except Start and End times which are Date/Timestamps.\r\nThere are no uniqueness constraints, duplicate rows could be allowed.  Resource is allowed to be null, all other fields I believe must not be null (it is possible that UsageValue may be null, I don't know).\r\n\r\nAllowed Queries: (this may seem like an exhaustive list, but in cassandra these all must be considered because it is not nearly as flexible with queries as a relational database is)\r\n* Search by account id and service\r\n* Search by account id, service, and operation\r\n* Search by account id, service, and usage type\r\n* Search by account id, service, and resource \r\n* Search by account id, service, operation, and resource\r\n* Search by account id, service, operation, and usage type\r\n* Search by account id, service, operation, resource, and usage type\r\n\r\nIn addition to all of the above, each query must also support 'start time' and 'end time', which is a ranged query, but it actually just checks against the 'endTime' field, and this field must support a ranged query.  The other fields can support just an 'equals' query.  If we wrote all combinations of fields, this would actually double or quadruple the number of queries above, depending on whether you consider the 'start time' and 'end time' constraints as separate queries.  For example, we could take the first query above and expand to\r\n* Search by account id and service\r\n* Search by account id and service and start date (range)\r\n* Search by account id and service and end date (range)\r\n* Search by account id and service and start date and end date (range)\r\n\r\nSo rather than going into the whole mapping exercise of mapping each table type, I will mention a couple of things, and describe the solution I have come up with.  \r\n\r\n# First of all, ranged queries (<, >, etc) can only be performed on a cluster column, and only after all partition key columns are bound with equality, and all 'previous' cluster columns are also bound with equality.  This means that the 'end time' field must be a cluster column.   Cluster columns are also not required to be used for search, so this allows this field to be optionally searched.\r\n# Secondary indexes can be created on single fields that are not part of the partition key to allow equality searching against non partition-key and non-cluster columns, but it is recommended for fields with a low number of possible values.  Queries using only the secondary index have to span the entire node space to find all of the rows, which can take a lot of time, but combining secondary index queries with known partition keys are very fast, as only one partition is checked.  High cardinality secondary indexes are discouraged.\r\n# To allow 'duplicates' (as a row is uniquely defined by a primary key, a unique id is often added as a cluster column.\r\n\r\nSo here is the CQL that was used for the above data model\r\n{code}\r\nCREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS eucalyptus_billing \r\n  WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':1}; \r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS eucalyptus_billing.aws_records (\r\n    account_id TEXT,\r\n    service TEXT,\r\n    operation TEXT,\r\n    usage_type TEXT,\r\n    resource TEXT,\r\n    start_time TIMESTAMP,\r\n    end_time TIMESTAMP,\r\n    usage_value TEXT, \r\n    natural_id TIMEUUID,\r\n    operation_usage_type_concat TEXT, \r\n    PRIMARY KEY((account_id, service), end_time, natural_id)\r\n  ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (end_time ASC, natural_id ASC);\r\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS aws_records_operation_idx \r\n    ON eucalyptus_billing.aws_records (operation);\r\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS aws_records_usage_type_idx \r\n    ON eucalyptus_billing.aws_records (usage_type);\r\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS aws_records_operation_usage_type_idx \r\n    ON eucalyptus_billing.aws_records (operation_usage_type_concat);\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS eucalyptus_billing.aws_records_by_resource (\r\n    account_id TEXT,\r\n    service TEXT,\r\n    operation TEXT,\r\n    usage_type TEXT,\r\n    resource TEXT,\r\n    start_time TIMESTAMP,\r\n    end_time TIMESTAMP,\r\n    usage_value TEXT, \r\n    natural_id TIMEUUID,\r\n    operation_usage_type_concat TEXT, \r\n    PRIMARY KEY((account_id, service, resource), end_time, natural_id)\r\n  ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (end_time ASC, natural_id ASC);\r\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS aws_records_by_resource_operation_idx \r\n    ON eucalyptus_billing.aws_records_by_resource (operation);\r\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS aws_records_by_resource_usage_type_idx \r\n    ON eucalyptus_billing.aws_records_by_resource (usage_type);\r\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS aws_records_by_resource_operation_usage_type_idx \r\n    ON eucalyptus_billing.aws_records_by_resource (operation_usage_type_concat);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nand some notes on the above.\r\n# The first table aws_records is used for all queries that did not pass in 'resource'.  I will focus on that table first.\r\n# Since all queries require account_id and service, it made sense to use those two fields as the partition key of aws_records.\r\n# Using end_time as the first clustering column allowed that field to be optionally used in a ranged query. (Which takes care of the start/end date field)\r\n# To allow for non-unique rows (i.e. the same fields twice), a secondary clustering column (which I call natural_id) is used, though in our case never queried.\r\n# Secondary indexes on operation and usage_type allow for quick searching against either field, given account_id and service.\r\n# Since secondary indexes do not allow search against multiple fields, a single redundant field operation_usage_type_concat was also added, which is just the two fields operation and usage_type concatenated (with a '|' delimiter).  This allows search when both operation and usage_type are queried.\r\n# Secondary indexes are ok for operation and usage_type as they are expected to be from a fixed set of values which is relatively low.\r\n# Resource is an id, like instance id or volume id, and there is no guarantee that this value comes from a small set of values at all, so a secondary index is not optimal.  This is where denormalization occurs, which is a frequent occurrence in Cassandra occurs.  A second table, aws_records_by_resource was created with the same fields as the first table.\r\n# In aws_records_by_resource, it was assumed resource would be part of the query, so we add it as part of the partition key.\r\n# All other fields are in the same position that were described in the previous table, so we do the following\r\n## If the resource is passed in via the query method, search the aws_records_by_resource table (and search against resource), otherwise search the aws_records table.\r\n## Account id and service must be passed in so they can be searched against.  In either the resource or the non-resource case, the partition key is covered in the search.\r\n## A search against start time/end time can be done with a ranged query against end time.\r\n## A search against either operation or usageType can be done against their respective secondary indexes.  A search against both can be done against the concatenated column.\r\n#The above satisfies all queries.  The only missing piece is mentioning what happens during insert.  In this case both tables are populated on a new record, unless the resource is null, in which case only the aws_records table is populated.\r\n\r\nThere is a whole lot to digest in this post, so please mull it over, and also let me know if there is some other place that some of this information should be placed.

Insert and update are essentially the same operation for CQL. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nIf you start with a table:\r\n\r\ncreate table example (a int, b int, primary key (a));\r\nand then type\r\n\"update example set b = 2 where a = 1;\"\r\nand then search\r\n\"select * from example\"\r\nyou will see a single row with a = 1 and b = 2\r\nif you subsequently type\r\n\"insert into example (a,b) values (1,3)\"\r\nyou will see a single row with a = 1 and b = 3\r\n\r\nAs such, there are no uniqueness checks, just overrides.  Primary keys have to be unique, and clustering columns add the ability to both sort by a given field and have optional search fields in the query, but if we removed the natural_id field in this case we would have to uniquely identify each record by the combination of account id, service, and end date.  That is insufficiently unique.  Adding other fields to the primary key may be possible, but all fields in the primary key must be non-null.  We could say for example that account id, service, operation, usage type, and end date might uniquely identify a record, but I'm not sure about that.  \r\n\r\n[~spark]  What do you think about this?  Also, what is a good time to live for this information?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ethomas","name":"ethomas","key":"ethomas","accountId":"557058:8f092f9a-0724-44c0-84a3-0220705f856a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Evan Thomas","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-22T18:13:09.179-0500","updated":"2017-03-22T18:21:20.591-0500"}],"maxResults":6,"total":6,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-13159/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
