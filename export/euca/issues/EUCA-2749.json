This is thrown back through cacheImage() to a semaphore-protected part of getDecryptedImage(). Unfortunately the exception is not caught there, so the semaphore is never released, and that image cannot be decrypted again until the CLC is restarted.\n\n\nI supposed fixing problem 1 could prevent problem 2 from recurring, but really the semaphore-protected code should catch exceptions and release the semaphore when they occur. I wrapped the whole section in...\n\n<code>\ntry {\n   ...\n} catch (Exception ex) {\n      semaphore.release();\n      throw new EucalyptusCloudException(\"caught in semaphore-protected part of getDecryptedImage()\", ex);\n}\n</code>\n\nwhich seems to do the trick.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucabot","name":"eucabot","key":"eucabot","accountId":"557058:007ef05d-c772-4437-b383-d2b42d2a88a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Eucalyptus Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"created":"2012-07-11T08:30:28.823-0500","updated":"2012-07-11T08:30:28.823-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/14326/comment/30781","id":"30781","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=neil","name":"neil","key":"neil","accountId":"557058:bdcb5450-c2ec-4e86-a815-f842a934f480","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7497770f3e2aaa247f356838f1fd8ba2?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dneil%26avatarId%3D10703%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7497770f3e2aaa247f356838f1fd8ba2?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dneil%26avatarId%3D10703%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7497770f3e2aaa247f356838f1fd8ba2?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dneil%26avatarId%3D10703%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7497770f3e2aaa247f356838f1fd8ba2?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dneil%26avatarId%3D10703%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Neil Soman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This should be fixed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=neil","name":"neil","key":"neil","accountId":"557058:bdcb5450-c2ec-4e86-a815-f842a934f480","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7497770f3e2aaa247f356838f1fd8ba2?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dneil%26avatarId%3D10703%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7497770f3e2aaa247f356838f1fd8ba2?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dneil%26avatarId%3D10703%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7497770f3e2aaa247f356838f1fd8ba2?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dneil%26avatarId%3D10703%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7497770f3e2aaa247f356838f1fd8ba2?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dneil%26avatarId%3D10703%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Neil Soman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-08-07T16:27:06.620-0500","updated":"2012-08-07T16:27:06.620-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
