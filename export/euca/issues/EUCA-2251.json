Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Forgive the long comment, but I think this is a reasonable time to explain the semantics of ACLs in S3 since they are not obvious and are different than a typical file-system.\r\n\r\nS3 documentation of each permission applied to bucket and object:\r\nPermission --- When granted on a bucket --- When granted on an object\r\nREAD --- Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket --- Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata\r\n\r\nWRITE --- Allows grantee to create, overwrite, and delete any object in the bucket --- Not applicable\r\n\r\nREAD_ACP --- Allows grantee to read the bucket ACL --- Allows grantee to read the object ACL\r\nWRITE_ACP --- Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable bucket --- Allows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object\r\n\r\nFULL_CONTROL --- Allows grantee the READ, WRITE, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the bucket --- Allows grantee the READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the object\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per the S3 documentation here are the semantics of each canned ACL:\r\n\r\nCanned ACL ---Applies to --- Permissions added to ACL\r\nprivate --- Bucket and object --- Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. No one else has access rights (default).\r\n\r\npublic-read --- Bucket and object --- Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group ( see Specifying a Grantee) gets the READ access.\r\n\r\npublic-read-write --- Bucket and object --- Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AllUsers group gets READ and WRITE access. Granting this on a bucket is generally not recommended.\r\n\r\nauthenticated-read --- Bucket and object --- Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. The AuthenticatedUsers group gets READ access.\r\n\r\nbucket-owner-read --- Object --- Object owner gets FULL_CONTROL. Bucket owner gets READ access. If specified when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.\r\n\r\nbucket-owner-full-control --- Object --- Both the object owner and the bucket owner get FULL_CONTROL over the object. If you specify this canned ACL when creating a bucket, Amazon S3 ignores it.\r\n\r\nlog-delivery-write --- Bucket --- The LogDelivery group gets WRITE and the READ_ACP permission on the bucket. For more information on logs, see (Server Access Logging).\r\n\r\n\r\nResponse to each of these scenarios and what *should* happen:\r\n\r\n1) Bucket / key with canned acl 'authenticated-read' cannot be read\r\nThe assumption here is that this ACL should permit other authenticated users (in the same account?) to read the bucket or key.\r\n\r\nResponse: 'authenticated-read' specifies that Walrus authenticated users (those with valid credentials) can list the objects in a bucket (read on bucket) or read content & metadata of object (if applied to object). This will not be limited to the same account, but to ALL Walrus credential holders. I will verify behavior of this for both object and bucket. Object read is not necessarily allowed if 'authenticated-read' is set at bucket level.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Error setting content for key with canned ACL 'public-read-write' in a bucket with canned acl 'public-read'\r\nA bucket is created by user 1 with the canned ACL 'public-read' and a key is created in the bucket with the ACL 'public-read-write'.\r\nThe assumption is that user 2 (in the same account) should be able to update the key content.\r\n\r\n\r\nResponse: 'public-read-write' should allow anyone to both read and write objects and list objects in the bucket if set on a bucket. The owner of an object should have FULL_CONTROL. I will check into this as well.\r\n\r\n3) Error setting canned acl on a key created in another users bucket (bucket has canned acl 'public-read-write')\r\nA bucket is created by user 1 with the canned ACL 'public-read-write'. User 2 (in the same account) creates a key and then attempts to set the canned ACL 'bucket-owner-read'.\r\nThe assumption is that user 2 should be able to set the ACL on the key they created.\r\n\r\nResponse: This is correct behavior. READ_ACP & WRITE_ACP (access control policy) are different permissions than READ/WRITE which are what 'public-read-write' grants. Those permissions are retained by the bucket owner unless explicitly granted to other users.\r\n\r\n4) Any value can be used for a canned ACL without causing an error\r\n\r\nResponse: This should probably cause a 400-bad-request error. The current behavior of the system is to just ignore a bad ACL and process any valid ones. This shouldn't allow permission elevation, but should return an error so the user knows that the acl was not applied.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-06-04T14:09:43.123-0500","updated":"2012-06-04T17:33:04.873-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/13345/comment/27826","id":"27826","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Upon further investigation of #2 I can see that Walrus is treating the 'public-read-write' permission incorrectly. Setting 'public-read-write' should set AllUsers group to have READ and WRITE permissions, but not READ_ACP or WRITE_ACP. Currently setting public-read-write grants FULL_CONTROL to AllUsers, which is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThis should probably be a 3.1 blocker. The permissions we actually grant are higher than the specs for 'public-read-write'--it's actually FULL_CONTROL we grant.\r\n\r\nThe same is true for public-read. We are granting READ_ACP and READ rather than just READ. We also don't support the S3 canned-acls: 'bucket-owner-read' and 'bucket-owner-full-control' that can be applied to objects (but not
