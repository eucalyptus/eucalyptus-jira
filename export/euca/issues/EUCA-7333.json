Gangisetty","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~shaon]: Volume creation from snapshots in Eucalyptus translates to flex cloning and splitting of volumes on the NetApp SAN. This process has a time out of 30 minutes and can be configured by  modifying {{<cluster>.storage.cloneretries}} property. The default value is high since we have seen the clone and split operation take longer for larger volumes. If the instance was terminated before the volume transitioned to available, it is likely that the delete on terminate flag triggered the delete request to SC but the SC rejected the request since the volume in not in a deletable state. Hence the volume correctly transitions to \"creating\" state which is the expected behavior. \r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2013-08-23 06:27:13 DEBUG 000000869 VmInstances              | i-16DC4649: Firing delete request for vol-A6BA3EA5\r\n2013-08-23 06:27:13  INFO 000000869 BlockStorage             | Processing DeleteStorageVolume request for volume vol-A6BA3EA5\r\n2013-08-23 06:27:13 ERROR 000000869 BlockStorage             | Error marking volume vol-A6BA3EA5 for deletion: Cannot delete volume in state: creating. Please retry later\r\n{noformat}\r\n\\\\ \r\nThe volume would have either been marked as failed if the creation process did not succeed with in the timeout limits or would have been available if the volume creation went through without any issues. Modifying the storage database record is an unsupported operation that could lead to undefined results and mismatch of state on the SAN and Eucalyptus. I would strongly recommend against modifying database entries to be able to delete volumes.  \r\n\r\nAs for the issue with NetApp, it looks like the snapshot that was being cloned seems to have locked up. I have seen this happen before when concurrent flex clone operations are requested off the same flex volume. This may be an issue with the NetApp ONTAP, I'll dig into it and update the ticket as I find more details. After examining the logs and the NetApp SAN, the issue does not seem to be Eucalyptus specific i.e. I don't expect to see a Eucalyptus code fix that could resolve this issue. \r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n2013-08-23 06:27:57 DEBUG 000007068 XmlApiInvocation         | Executing API request volume-clone-create to 10.109.2.1:\r\n                          | <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><!DOCTYPE netapp SYSTEM 'file:/etc/netapp_filer.dtd'><netapp xmlns=\"http://www.netapp.com/filer/admin\" version=\"1.0\"><volume-clone-create><parent-volume>snap_70023AA0</parent-volume><volume>vol_0A553D38</volume></volume-clone-create></netapp>\r\n2013-08-23 06:27:57 DEBUG 000007068 XmlApiInvocation         | Received API response for volume-clone-create from 10.109.2.1:\r\n                          | <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' ?>\r\n                          | <!DOCTYPE netapp SYSTEM '/na_admin/netapp_filer.dtd'>\r\n                          | <netapp version='1.1' xmlns='http://www.netapp.com/filer/admin'>\r\n                          | <results status=\"failed\" errno=\"13156\" reason=\"The volume is not currently available\"/></netapp>\r\n2013-08-23 06:27:57 DEBUG 000007068 NetappAdapter            | #flexCloneAndSplitVolume#vol_0A553D38: Flex volume to be cloned is in use or not available.
