The ordering on of the jars on the file system changes with each build and because the bindings order was also variable we saw this issue on indeterminate installs. What this fix does is remove the binding order as a variable with the sorted treeMap so that if we see this issue it will be on 'all' installs of a particular build. If we see this binding issue i.e. \"org.jibx.runtime.JiBXException\" we need to rebuild.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mmunn1","name":"mmunn1","key":"mmunn1","accountId":"557058:6e62b7e8-e48f-469d-ac54-e9449dec5cd9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6638eee119e9c0bdcca16883c5415349?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmmunn1%26avatarId%3D11300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6638eee119e9c0bdcca16883c5415349?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmmunn1%26avatarId%3D11300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6638eee119e9c0bdcca16883c5415349?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmmunn1%26avatarId%3D11300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6638eee119e9c0bdcca16883c5415349?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmmunn1%26avatarId%3D11300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael Munn","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-06T17:28:45.583-0600","updated":"2014-01-06T17:28:45.583-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/26024/comment/60126","id":"60126","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The ordering of the jars of the file system varies between installs, but it does not depend on the build as far as I know.
