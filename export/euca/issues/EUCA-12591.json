Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The following approach with access control lists can be used as an alternative to bucket policies for managing billing report upload permissions.\r\n\r\nThe bucket for report upload should be created with write permission (x-amz-grant-write) for the billing account. The permission could use the canonical identifier for the billing account or we could create a eucalyptus specific special group similar to the log delivery group used by AWS. Using a canonical identifier would be the safest approach due to tool compatibility (tools may use enums for groups for example, making it hard to use non-standard groups)\r\n\r\nThe billing account would upload reports to the report upload bucket using the canned acl \"bucket-owner-full-control\". Objects created in this way can be overwritten by the billing account but the bucket owner account also has full control for the object. Using a canned acl results in the billing account having more permissions on report objects than are necessary. If we wanted to narrow the permissions we would have to determine the canonical identifier for the report bucket owner and use explicitly specified access permissions for that grantee ( and fix EUCA-12628 )\r\n\r\nIf we wish to allow verification of the bucket permissions we may want to also have the report bucket owner grant \"x-amz-grant-read-acp\" for the billing account (this is comparable to the \"s3:GetBucketAcl\" and \"s3:GetBucketPolicy\" permissions in the bucket policy used with AWS/S3 for billing)\r\n\r\nThe outlined approach requires initial bucket configuration that is comparable to that for using bucket policies. As per bucket policies:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nYou should deny IAM user access to the bucket for IAM users who do not need access to your bills.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-permissions-ref.html#example-billing-s3-bucket\r\n\r\nWhile managing permissions using acls is possible for reporting use it is not ideal. We will want to support bucket policies in future releases and it would be best to use bucket policies with reporting to avoid future upgrade issues.\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve
