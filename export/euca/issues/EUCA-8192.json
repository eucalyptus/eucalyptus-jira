Due to a typo /etc/eucalyptus/eucalytpus.conf had some erroneous entries in its DHCP section (duplicated IP/ETH address pair). \r\n\r\nAs a result the eucalytpus DHCP server would not run since these errors would propagate into the automatically generated /var/run/eucalyptus/net/euca-dhcp.conf. \r\n\r\nFixed errors in eucalyptus.conf. Re-started. Re-initialized. Re-installed packages. Deleted and recreated db. Deleted/recreated /var/run directory. Deleted/recreated /etc/eucalytpus directory. \r\n\r\n12 hours of all/any of these combinations did not change the fact that  euca-dhcp.conf kept being generated with the same erroneous information (same IP address for two different MAC=IP pairs) that had once been in eucalyptus.conf -- which in turn prevented the eucalyptus DHCP server to run. \r\n\r\nNumerous recursive find+greps on the ENTIRE system for the duplicated IP address yielded no results outside of the http-cc_error_log file where the error appeared as \"host XXX already exists\". \r\n\r\nThe only solution was reinstalling the system. \r\n\r\nThis seems like a serious bug -- whoever generates the euca-dhcp.conf file (apparently the cloud binaries matched for that) -- if there is an error in the original eucalyptus.conf -- gets stuck with it forever.\r\n\r\nI don't have any of these logs/info anymore since I have reinstalled this system but I thought i'd help you by reporting this.\r\n\r\nThe problem is easily duplicated: single-machine install.

I have just a couple of questions if you don't mind:\r\n\r\n1) This issue is filed in the \"BROKER\" project, which is for VMware Broker issues, but I don't see a VMware reference here.  Am I correct in assuming that this was intended to be a bug against Eucalyptus proper?  If so, I can move it.\r\n\r\n2) Did you run \"service eucalyptus-cc cleanrestart\" at any point in this process?  I suspect the data was store in the data files in /var/lib/eucalyptus/CC , which are only completely cleaned out on a \"clean{stop,start,restart}\".
