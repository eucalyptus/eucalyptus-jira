The index will never decrease, and while the memory is freed on each completion of describeInstances(), the intermediate memory usage that is allocated to store the response will grow unbounded (as long as the cache continues to be full).\r\n\r\nThis in turn led to swapping on the CC which led to slowness to the degree where certain operations were exceeding the 60 second CLC<->CC operation timeout, which led to the CLC disabling the CC periodically.\r\n\r\nFix is to improve the instance cache logic to prevent the condition in the first place, and also to alter its behavior to give precedence in the cache to non-teardown state instances when the cache is under limit pressure.  In such a scenario, cache entries will be chosen for new instances using the following precendence:\r\n\r\n1) any empty cache slot\r\n2) any instance in the cache that is in Teardown and has been 'described' by the CLC at least once\r\n3) any instance in the cache that is in Teardown\r\n\r\nwhen option 3 triggers, instances in Teardown will not be reported to the CLC, but they will be put back in the cache when a space (1 or 2) is available in future
