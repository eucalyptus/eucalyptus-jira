Between ELB and other services, all communications happen through public APIs to achieve the clean separation of concerns. However this design exposes issues when:\r\n -- EC2 fails to fulfill the request, for instance due to insufficient resources\r\n -- There are unexpected failures during the operation (e.g., Vm termination)\r\n\r\nWith the current design of EC2, it is not possible to fail upfront because we cannot check all the prerequisite of the successful operation of ELB. For instance, EC2 does not have an API to check the availability of private IPs. \r\n\r\nNormally, we would expose the changing operational state of ELB to users, but the lack of API support prevent us to do so. In AWS, if ELBs experience failures, the users are expected to contact customer service. \r\n\r\nThere are implementation options to get around the lack of API support:\r\n -- Return ELB's status information in DescribeInstanceHealth response. The rationale is that users would eventually register backend instances and use this API to check the status. We should coordinate the health check by autoscaling group to avoid instance churn.\r\n -- Use tagging to deliver the extra state information. One issue is that the tag is not included in DescribeLoadBalancers which is probably the API that people most frequently use.
