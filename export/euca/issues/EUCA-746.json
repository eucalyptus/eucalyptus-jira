This is a big security problem if a session id of a\nuser is stolen. In this case, if all sessions for this account are not\ninvalidated, the password change will not prevent the attacker from using the\naccount (and, as I understand, in our design, not all accounts/users can be\ndeleted). To prevent this situation, on a password change, the current user's\nsession could simply get a new session id and all other user's session should\nbe invalidated.
