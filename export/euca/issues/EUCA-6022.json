Create three security groups: 'sourcegroup1', 'sourcegroup2' and 'destinationgroup'\r\n\r\n2. Create rules for 'destinationgroup' as follows:\r\n  - Allow TCP Port 22 from securitygroup 'sourcegroup1'\r\n  - Allow TCP Port 22 from securitygroup 'sourcegroup2'\r\n\r\n3. Launch three instances, one for each of the above security groups.\r\n\r\n4. Attempt to SSH from the instance in 'sourcegroup1' to the instance in 'destinationgroup'\r\n\r\n5.
