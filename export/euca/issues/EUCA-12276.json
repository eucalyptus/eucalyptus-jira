include more Midokura side configuration under it's 'Mido' json block. \r\n\r\nA very common question, and/or criticism during manual (non cookbook) installations is that Euca should own the additional Mido config dependencies:\r\n- Tunnel Zone \r\n- Tunnel Zone Host Membership\r\n- BGP config for Euca's Mido-GWs\r\n\r\n\r\n-These changes will affect the json schema in the network_configuration property, GNI, GNI parsing, and eucanetd provisioning. Now vs later discussions should also take into account any additional complexity needed to support upgrading these items on live systems, etc..\r\n\r\n- Tunnelzone name may already be hardcoded in Euca (eucanetd 4.3 accepts mido-tz, midotz, euca-tz, or eucatz)? Is there a benefit to having an external process control the creation of this? Euca VPC will not function without this being created and properly configured outside of Eucalyptus. Adding capacity(nodes) may introduce another area for human or external process error. \r\n\r\n- BGP information is tied to artifacts eucalyptus is responsible for creating (ie the primary router) and possibly tearing down (ie through eucanetd flush). This creates an awkward configuration dependency loop. A user must wait for euca to be configured and running before they can configure the BGP portion. Eucalyptus VMs will not have traffic routed until an external process which is waiting on it's own state addresses the remaining configuration.\r\n\r\n- Related to BGP, how to support static routing configuration? Static routing configuration has many more variations (compared to BGP), and may be better to be done external to Euca. \r\n\r\n- Eucanetd can not restore a working system on it's own after flushing it's own artifacts. BGP may be the only reason this can not be done today?\r\n \r\nThanks!\r\n-Matt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"VPC - EUCA should manage Mido; TunnelZone, Host membership, and BGP configuration","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mclark","name":"mclark","key":"mclark","accountId":"557058:9b68e4d6-90d8-47d3-9c86-519770009164","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mclark","name":"mclark","key":"mclark","accountId":"557058:9b68e4d6-90d8-47d3-9c86-519770009164","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_10000":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i03qfj:","customfield_10001":"2016-05-17T12:47:03.135-0500","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["mclark(mclark)","sjones(sjones)","vasya(vasya)"],"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/42637/comment/103127","id":"103127","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Some notes from discussions on this issue.\r\n\r\nThe configuration cannot be derived from information that eucanetd currently has access to. The tunnel zone does not necessarily match the NC information we use elsewhere and bgp termination is not currently available.\r\n\r\nAdding this functionality to eucanetd is not trivial as we do not current manage these types of resources.\r\n\r\nWe would need to add properties to the network information so that eucanetd had the required information to perform configuration. As this additional configuration is required upgrade would not be an issue as when configuration was not present the existing behaviour (expect manual configuration of midonet) could be preserved.\r\n\r\nWe should probably automate the simple case(s) and allow manual midonet configuration for complex or unusual cases.\r\n\r\nExternal tooling for configuration of midonet could be another option.
