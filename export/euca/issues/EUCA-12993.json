I have been meaning to work up some instructios for the documentation to give to [~kmeredith], but haven't gotten to that yet.  I will do that today.\r\n\r\n[~ccassler] can you add \"modprobe br_netfilter\" to your procedure before step 5 on this page: https://docs.eucalyptus.com/eucalyptus/4.3.0/#install-guide/configuring_bridge.html\r\n\r\nbr_netfilter and bridge modules need to be loaded on the NC before the network restart occurs in step 5.\r\n\r\nI will also be working on EUCA-12983 to handle this in the NC itself, but for now the workaround will be to manually load these modules.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mbacchi","name":"mbacchi","key":"mbacchi","accountId":"557058:d650aabc-f00c-4262-93a9-7799945b8eed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/24b916c1ff78f38b51f4bb1dc66ed58c?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmbacchi%26avatarId%3D16201%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/24b916c1ff78f38b51f4bb1dc66ed58c?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmbacchi%26avatarId%3D16201%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/24b916c1ff78f38b51f4bb1dc66ed58c?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmbacchi%26avatarId%3D16201%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/24b916c1ff78f38b51f4bb1dc66ed58c?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmbacchi%26avatarId%3D16201%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Bacchi","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2016-12-05T10:45:32.874-0600","updated":"2016-12-05T10:45:32.874-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/51502/comment/113907","id":"113907","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tony","name":"tony","key":"tony","accountId":"557058:353956db-b78c-4f3b-9096-f8f58e6709c8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tony Beckham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"[~ccassler], if you manually load the br_netfilter module does this go away?
