That is, an EMI that is unbootable should not be in the 'available' state.  Before 4.0 this problem was not addressable.  It is in 4.0+ and I'm removing it as an Affects Version.  The problem described here is not applicable in 4.0.\r\n\r\nWhile it is part of the design, we can track a separate issue to ensure the right *outcome* in the 4.0 series.   Specifically:  An EMI should only be in the 'available' state if it is bootable. \r\n\r\nThe problem prior to 4.0 was due to the disconnect between image registration in the EC2 service implementation, and the caching of decrypted images in Walrus.  There was no way for the EC2 service to determine that the decryption had failed.  As a result, the EMI for the image continued to be in the 'available' state despite not being bootable.\r\n\r\nThe new image management services in 4.0.x make this problem addressable (if not already addressed):\r\n- Manifest AES values are handled by the EC2 service: the incorrect keys used during bundling, like in this case, would cause it to never succeed to register as an EMI in 4.0.\r\n- Paravirt instance-store image bundles will be processed by the imaging service prior to entering the 'available' state:  this means that the kinds of decryption data errors we have seen in the past (but are _not_ what is indicated here) are also addressed for this types of images.\r\n\r\nEnd effect:  3.4.x has limited means to address this problem. 4.0.x is not affected.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=decker","name":"decker","key":"decker","accountId":"557058:518b1ab0-12c2-4e72-b694-6c07036941a8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"do not want!
