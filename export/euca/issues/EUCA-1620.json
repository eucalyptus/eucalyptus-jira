I'm going to press internally for us to run one of our dev/test cloud in permissive mode and start defining some policy there.  And I'll also be doing some testing on the Fedora side, though it will be a little different due to changes in file locations.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=agrimm","name":"agrimm","key":"agrimm","accountId":"557058:9ebc3512-73d8-45c9-85de-4325aaa62488","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Andy Grimm","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2012-09-13T15:34:35.596-0500","updated":"2012-09-13T15:34:35.596-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/12225/comment/32424","id":"32424","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Michael is talking about creating a few smaller switches rather than flipping The Big Switch.
