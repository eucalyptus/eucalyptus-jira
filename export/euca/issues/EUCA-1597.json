This token\nis used for authenticating a user when the X509Download servlet is called for\ngetting the user's credentials. Because on the systems with little entropy for\nrandomness, esp. those server machines like we have in the QA, generating\nrandom numbers is really slow. That's why creating a user on such systems are\nslow. A natural thought would be to generate the token by demand. However,\nsince the \"euca_conf --get-credentials\" retrieves the token directly from the\ndatabase, the CLC would not be able to generate the token on the fly. I see\nthere are a couple ways to solve this:\n\n  \n1. Providing the CLC machine with some entropy somehow.\n\n2. Providing a different way for client tools to get credentials without\nrelying on getting the token directly from database, so that the token is not\nnecessary when creating a user.\n\n3. The worst case, during LDAP sync, generating tokens for the users\nasynchronously. There will be a period of time that you can not get\ncredentials for many of the users while the tokens are being generated.\n\n  \nOn Wed Feb 01 08:24:38 2012, vic.iglesias wrote:\n\n> This is a bug to track the investigation of ways to make the LDAP sync\n\n> process\n\n> faster.
