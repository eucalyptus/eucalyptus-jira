(This is 58,000 data points per minute).  The system (QA standard setup) seemed to be able to handle this load, but took 50 seconds or so to process the data in the worst cases, so not many more points could be put in.  This is about 1/10th the desired capacity.  Some improvement might be done at scale to put metric data at each UFS, but the scale is not linear.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it appears that at least 6 TB would be needed to store the data in the database for 10,000 instances at a 1 minute granularity for 2 weeks.
