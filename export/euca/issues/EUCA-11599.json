There are 3 queues in the system, one to deal with \"absolute metrics\" (convert the data returned from the backend, which tends to be a cumulative value, into a \"diff\" against the previous value), one to deal with put metric data, and one to deal with putting the fields needed for \"list metrics\".  In each of the queues, the values that you are interested in looking at are logged.\r\n\r\nThe first queue is in the source code under com.eucalyptus.cluster.callback.reporting.AbsoluteMetricQueue.  It runs on the clc (cluster manager), once a minute, and its output can be found in cloud-cluster.log.  Currently the log level of the items you want are at TRACE.  (They should probably be moved to a higher level, at least to check monitoring)\r\n\r\nThe second queue is in the source code under com.eucalyptus.cloudwatch.service.queue.metricdata.MetricDataQueue.  It runs on each ufs, once a minute, and its output can be found in cloud-output.log.  Currently the log level of the items you want are at DEBUG.  (Again, they should probably be moved to a higher level for monitoring)\r\n\r\nThe second queue is in the source code under com.eucalyptus.cloudwatch.service.queue.listmetrics.ListMetricQueue.  It runs on each ufs, once every 5 minutes, and its output can be found in cloud-output.log.  Currently the log level of the items you want are at DEBUG.  (Again, they should probably be moved to a higher level for monitoring)\r\n\r\nThe source code for all of these classes is somewhat similar.  There is a Runnable called \"safeRunner\" in each class, and the run() method of each is where things are logged.  What is currently logged is the number of items drained from each queue at the time each operation occurs, and the timing of each operation that occurs.  Each queue has timing for intermediate steps (which is only really useful to determine bottlenecks) and total time taken.  We want to make sure that under load, the number of items drained from each queue remains about the same (or at least doesn't grow without bound) and that the total time each operation takes is less than the polling frequency for each queue.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, to determine if the correct 'number' of items are in each queue, try running metrics at a very small number, the number of items in each queue should approximately scale linearly with the number of instances or volumes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some logic was added to the AbsoluteMetricQueue to kick out some points if the queue is being clogged up.  We may want to disable this feature during monitoring.\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"EUCA-11558","customfield_11500":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=vasya","name":"vasya","key":"vasya","accountId":"557058:1c63481a-0634-4ae7-9004-cb0f143e141f","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Vasiliy

All Queues mentioned above were modified to pass performance info to QueueThruput. Data can be fetched via getDataPoints(int count) (for printing) or getDataPoints(MonitoredAction action) (for analytics) calls. QueueThruput does logging if needed.  I don't think performance reporting metrics for those queues should be logged with debug level if we have ability to retrieve needed data at hock and moved all to TRACE.  I've saved original log messages for now to have backwards comparability in case you already  have scripts to parse logs. Feel free to modify them. New system property cloudwatch.cloudwatch_monitoring_history_size is added to control number of data points for each monitored action in order to limit memory footprint. Default value for the history size is set to 100 entries for each action. All changes are currently in the dev-vasya-EUCA-11599 branch. Let me know if any questions/comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=vasya","name":"vasya","key":"vasya","accountId":"557058:1c63481a-0634-4ae7-9004-cb0f143e141f","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Vasiliy Kochergin","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-14T14:50:12.614-0600","updated":"2015-12-14T14:50:12.614-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/38998/comment/97051","id":"97051","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~vasya], can you add some simple aggregate computations there so we can dump the mean, median, min, max, and count for the items instead of the individual data points. Since the goal is to evaluate performance as we scale the system, I expect there to be thousands of datapoints per second possibly so we need a way to handle that that doesn't time-out or require frequent flushes. Please leave the code you have since it is good to be able to get the specific points if we want to, but also have an alternative method to just calculate running statistics rather than the raw data if desired.\r\n\r\nThere is also a sensor system in the java code (examples: internal/eucalyptus/clc/modules/troubleshooting/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/stats/sensors), we can leverage that next to dump the metrics out on an interval into the filesystem.

I do agree with Zach though, that we will probably want more than 100 data point values, and some aggregation would also be useful.  In terms of the data points that we are really interested in, the last of each points (i.e. probably total processing time per item) and number of items serviced in each queue are the most important.  The intermediate points could be useful to find bottlenecks, but not sure if they are as important for our stuff here.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ethomas","name":"ethomas","key":"ethomas","accountId":"557058:8f092f9a-0724-44c0-84a3-0220705f856a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Evan Thomas","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-15T18:11:49.686-0600","updated":"2015-12-15T18:11:49.686-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/38998/comment/97213","id":"97213","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=vasya","name":"vasya","key":"vasya","accountId":"557058:1c63481a-0634-4ae7-9004-cb0f143e141f","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Vasiliy Kochergin","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~zhill], I've added Aggregates getAggregates(MonitoredAction action) function that return mean, median, min, max, and count for all know data point for an action.
