her case the backing filesystem is ext3 but only workaround she could found which is not feasible is to terminate instances and manually clear the device mapper state. Infact in her case even the loopback devices didn't get clear up.\r\n\r\nThis is hitting us on field badly today. 4.0.2 and 4.1.0 both have this bug. Can we please make sure some quick progress is made on this one and an acceptable workaround can be formed. There should be way to identify and clear old and unused stuff instead of all of the artifacts that requires clearing all instances out of the NC in question.\r\n\r\nHope the above makes sense please

It appears that when you have destroyed an instance using {{virsh destroy}} on a NC where the instance was created using eucalyptus the NC does not cleanup artifacts in /var/lib/eucalyptus/instances/work/* for that instance. This is strange because in the labs we do not see this behaviour.\r\n\r\nOnce the instance is destroyed the NC, CC and CLC has forgotten about it and CLC marks it as terminated. Now [~prabhav] was able to bring this instance back to life by simply doing {{virsh create instance-libvirt.xml}} from inside the instance work directory. This was because the NC didn't clean these artifacts at the first place when the instance was destroyed. {{virsh create}} brought the instance back online and then we did a restart of NC service. Now interestingly the NC tries to delete the artifacts belonging to the instance we destroyed and created outside of Eucalyptus using {{virsh}} but failed to do so. Eventually it ends up adopting the instance and shows the state of the instance as {{EXTANT}}. This goes back to the CC and we can see in the cc.log that it has been getting information about this instance in {{doDescribeInstances}}. CLC however does not have any idea about this instance and hence no instance restore path was executed here.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile now the NC has reached in a state where no new instances will run on it. They all fail to get launched with the error as mentioned in this title of this BUG. I am not sure how that occurs but certainly in a failure test like this we would expect NC to do the right thing from the beginning.\r\n\r\nAlso with the same release of Eucalyptus here i.e. 4.0.2 I was unable to reproduce the problem in the exact same manner. So I am wondering if [~prabhav] has done any code changes in the Eucalyptus NC code to make sure the artifacts are not deleted after the instance is gone. That would explain the scenario , I say this because I saw [~prabhav] running Eucalyptus inside {{/opt/eucalyptus/}} and having the NC source code files open in another terminal.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDeependra","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra
