Outside of that, we follow the same approach as RHEL itself:  bumping minimum versions as changes in the software make them necessary rather than simply bumping them arbitrarily.  What you suggest _is_ a valid approach, but the approach we take is to let system administrators maintain the software we ship the same way that they maintain the rest of the operating system.  This does mean that divergence can happen, but unless we take control of the entire operating system like products such as VMware ESXi do, that will always happen to some degree.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-03T18:53:00.277-0600","updated":"2017-03-03T18:53:00.277-0600"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-13262/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
