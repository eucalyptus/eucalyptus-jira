There was an effort to package 3.1.0 at some point (uploaded 2012-10-05 by Brian Thomason), but it was removed from the unstable distribution at 2013-08-12 due to lack of activity fixing rc bugs - see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=715379\r\n\r\nOf course, eucalyptus is currently a very fast moving target to support in Debian that has a fairly slow release cycle, so having it in the official distribution might not be feasible, at least until it reaches a mature and stable phase. There should be the commitment to provide security patches for releases that are considered obsolete by upstream, and Eucalyptus is probably too large and complicated to be maintained by any single (volunteer) DD.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think that for users seeking the most bleeding edge mainstream distro, Fedora is often the chosen, and of course it is closely related to RHEL.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=pablo","name":"pablo","key":"pablo","accountId":"557058:e2460987-e075-4fa1-b902-2d2397f65743","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Henrik Ahlgren","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2013-11-15T09:52:55.467-0600","updated":"2013-11-15T09:56:19.193-0600"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
