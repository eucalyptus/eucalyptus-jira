security groups. iptables-save also takes 3-5 minutes to display. \r\n\r\nCurrently, there are 4 security groups in use:\r\n* Default with 6 ports/rules defined\r\n* internal.default with 355 ports/rules defined\r\n* datasink.default with 289 ports/rules defined\r\n* webapp.default with 133 ports/rules defined\r\n\r\nAnytime there is an attempt to add a new rule to one of the 3 main security groups, it can take more than an hour for that rule to be applied to the security group (per monitoring iptables and checking port access). Applying a new rule to the default security group happens within seconds.  \r\n\r\nCurrent workload distribution is single cluster with approx. 90 instances spread across all 3 primary security groups.  \r\n\r\n*Additional Troubleshooting*\r\n\r\nWe decided to start about 50 instances and added them to different security groups. Each group had less than 100 rules. There was not a significant delay until we started referencing account IDs as the source for incoming traffic....not sure what that's all about. Anyway, attached are files with the output of various commands. We're still looking at around a 20-25 second delay in retrieving the network topology from the CLC.\r\n\r\n*AWS Reference*\r\n\r\nAs noted in the AWS EC2 Security Group documentation, here are the current limitations:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nIn EC2-Classic, you can create up to 500 security groups in each region for each account. In EC2-VPC, you can create up to 100 security groups per VPC. The security groups for EC2-Classic do not count against the security group limit for EC2-VPC.\r\n\r\nIn EC2-Classic, you can add up to 100 rules per security group. In EC2-VPC, you can add up to 50 rules per security group. If you need additional rules for an instance, you can assign it multiple security groups.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIs there something here that needs to be addressed by tuning iptables (i.e. changing some sysctl values)?  For example, changing the following sysctl variables (these are just examples...maybe there are others that need to be changed):\r\n\r\n* net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh*\r\n* net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max \r\n* net.core.rmem_max\r\n* net.core.wmem_max\r\n* net.core.rmem_default\r\n* net.core.wmem_default\r\n* net.ipv4.tcp_mem\r\n* net.ipv4.tcp_rmem\r\n*
