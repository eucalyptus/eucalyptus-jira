Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"notes on design:\r\n\r\nOne of the problems in dealing with these large image sets (all images ~20K, amazon images ~580) is that fetching the list from EC2 (mostly for the 20K set) takes a long time. Not only does it take a long time, but it takes a fairly good chunk of memory to cache it.\r\nThe original idea to help with this was to have these data sets shared across users and managed separately from user-specific data sets. This hasn't been implemented yet, but in an effort to get it done, I want to document some of the challenges. I do this in part to inform, but also to help with my thought process in designing this bit of code.\r\nHere are some considerations in no particular order;\r\n- caches should be maintained separately from the user caches (attached to their session)\r\n- fetching this data requires some access credentials, so cannot be done proactively before any user logs in\r\n- notification for updates needs to be done for all user sessions logged into AWS (but maybe shouldn't be done all at once?)\r\n- a large data set could block tornado while it is being sent, considerations to minimize this time?\r\n- refreshing these caches should be managed independently of any user, so a user request for this data should not influence the fetch cycle of the shared cache\r\n\r\nI propose writing a separate bit of code with a fairly simple interface. It would re-use the existing cache object and override the push mechanism by a bit of trickery. It can pass a special object for the \"user session\" which is how the cache code gets access to the push handler. This special object would \"look\" like a user-session with attached push handler, but this code would instead scan the sessions dictionary to find users's w/ aws logins and push only to them. In addition this code would have a notification call made when any user logs in with aws credentials and that would accept a new set of aws creds which would be used when fetching this data. This would maintain the freshest set of credentials to use for this purpose. If the fetch fails for authentication reasons, the cache would simply not update. Updating would be able to continue when new credentials are passed and the \"old\" data would still be available. The poll frequency for these caches would be long, every 20 minutes initially, but could be configured. Any tag data received with the data would be stripped so that it is \"user neutral\". Tags get applied on the client side by the eucacollection object, so the user won't see this.\r\n\r\nAnother change we may want to make is to treat these image sets differently on the client. Currently, data sets are pulled in 2 cases;\r\n1. if we change landing page, all resources needed are pulled from the proxy\r\n2. if we get a push notification from the proxy\r\n\r\nCase 1 is actually handled via a forced push in the proxy. There's a flag set to push no matter what when \"SetDataInterest\" is called. I think by separating these data sets out from the regular user caches, we can remove this feature for the large data sets, but we'd need to make sure they are fetched at least once for a user session (or if an actual change is detected).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David
