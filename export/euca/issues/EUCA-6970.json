Do you think it would be better to track desiredCapacity, as long as it didn't fall below the original max? The same will apply to Min... once it moves down you can't bring it back up. \n\nI think the right answer is to make min/max adjustable as well, so you can pull them back to acceptable bounds if you need to. Already have code in there for it, just have to toggle a model attribute to tell the template to use it.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jpommer","name":"jpommer","key":"jpommer","accountId":"557058:3f09f5da-413f-44e2-a66b-4378792969a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jerry Pommer","active":false,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2013-07-12T12:43:07.045-0500","updated":"2013-07-12T12:43:07.045-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/22508/comment/49657","id":"49657","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"\"I\" think if we imagine the min and max as rubber bands that we can push lower or higher, but they snap back to the original value, that would be helpful to the user.

Anything < old max leaves new max unchanged. dc == old_max resets max.\nSetting dc to < old min set min to that. > old min leaves min unchanged. dc == old min resets min.\n\nSo, almost. The question now is what if you bump up from max 4 to max 8, but want dc set to 4. Truth table looks something like:\n\ndc                              | max | min\n------------------------------------------\n>max                          | set     | x\n<min                           | x        | set\n=old max                     | reset | x\n=old min                      | x       | reset\n>old min && <old max | x        | x\n\nSo you can't set dc to old max without resetting max, or min to old min without resetting min.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jpommer","name":"jpommer","key":"jpommer","accountId":"557058:3f09f5da-413f-44e2-a66b-4378792969a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jerry Pommer","active":false,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2013-07-12T14:02:55.587-0500","updated":"2013-07-12T14:02:55.587-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/22508/comment/49672","id":"49672","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tjcramer","name":"tjcramer","key":"tjcramer","accountId":"557058:e076cf45-80ca-4b67-befb-7b0c21f32739","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tim Cramer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~jpommer], [~dkavanagh], [~jloza].
