EUCA-12478 captures the one known bug so far.\r\n\r\nIf a user has changed something in a config file pre-upgrade, then the upgrade doesn't touch it, and instead installs the new default file in the same directory with the extra suffix {{__.rpmnew}}. Therefore, any changes for this release in the config file won't take effect. This could cause breakage. Also, we could fix a bug, or improve a feature, but it won't get applied because its piece in the config file won't be added or changed. \r\n\r\nThe only solution so far seems to be documenting for the user to copy/edit individual lines post-upgrade from the {{.rpmnew}} file to the existing config file, without the user knowing necessarily what those new lines mean (they just have to do it, so Euca works correctly). \r\n\r\nThat doesn't seem like a good user experience. Ideally, I'd think we'd want code to examine the users' changes in the pre-upgrade config file, then lay down our new default config file and apply the user's changes to that?\r\n\r\nHave we just been lucky so far, that doing config file upgrades this way has not led to these breakage issues in the past? Or how has Euca dealt with them? Are there any other configuration files that could have this issue too?\r\n\r\nSpecific examples I see:\r\n\r\n1. console.ini: worker class\r\nSee EUCA-12478\r\n\r\n2. console.ini: cache.memory.url\r\n{noformat}\r\n92c95\r\n< cache.memory.url = 127.0.0.1:11211\r\n---\r\n> cache.memory.url = /var/run/eucaconsole/memcached.sock\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nI assume this is from GUI-1782  \"Start memcached to listen only on unix domain socket, not network\". If this change doesn't get applied during the upgrade, what breaks? Or what becomes limited or not fixed? What do we need to document?\r\n\r\n3. console.ini: default.regionsetting\r\n\r\nI see DOC-1838 \"Federation: default.regionsetting added in console.ini\". If someone upgrades an already-federated cluster (or any cluster), what breaks or is missing?\r\n\r\n4. /etc/eucalyptus/eucalyptus.conf: MAX_INSTANCES_PER_CC\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nMAX_INSTANCES_PER_CC=\"128\"\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIf a user changes anything in eucalyptus.conf pre-upgrade, then this change won't take effect, right?\r\n\r\nSame question: What's going to break? what will be the symptoms? What do we tell users to do about it?\r\n\r\n5. /etc/eucalyptus/httpd.conf\r\n\r\nI don't see any changes between the file in my 4.2.2 and 4.3 clusters, so are we off the hook this time? \r\n\r\n6+. What other changes have we made that I just don't see in my current EQS clusters?\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Config file changes don't take effect on upgrade, if user has edited it pre-upgrade","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12100":"0|i03tpb:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_130289580","customfield_10001":"2016-06-21T14:53:59.805-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["dmitrii(dmitrii)","lincoln.thomas(lincoln.thomas)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-12479/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/44814/comment/105216","id":"105216","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"1.
