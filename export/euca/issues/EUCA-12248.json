The issue I found consistently in your setup is that network interfaces in the servo VM is not setup correctly. One reason is EUCA-12259 and I also see temporal disconnection with no reason. Once these things are settled, then health-check configuration works fine. So I think it was probably a coincidence. You can check elb-zone and elb-zone2 in that setup.
