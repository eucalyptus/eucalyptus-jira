Many of our customers moved to HVM images since we suggested them to go with HVM images.  We need to implement HVM support for euca-bundle-vol command as it helps end users to take snapshot of running instances. With euca-budle-instance command, end users need access to CLC's  private key file for unbundling the images after taking snapshot of running instances and registration. We have suggested customers to use euca-bundle-vol command for taking snapshot of instance since user does not need to have access to private key.\r\n\r\nThanks,","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"HVM images support need to be implemented for euca-bundle-vol command","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kshaik","name":"kshaik","key":"kshaik","accountId":"557058:c99aa270-2e4b-40a1-a392-ecf800a93a31","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6d01908cb401ffb023e2d01e4f9150c9?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6d01908cb401ffb023e2d01e4f9150c9?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6d01908cb401ffb023e2d01e4f9150c9?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6d01908cb401ffb023e2d01e4f9150c9?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kasim Shaik","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kshaik","name":"kshaik","key":"kshaik","accountId":"557058:c99aa270-2e4b-40a1-a392-ecf800a93a31","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6d01908cb401ffb023e2d01e4f9150c9?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6d01908cb401ffb023e2d01e4f9150c9?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6d01908cb401ffb023e2d01e4f9150c9?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6d01908cb401ffb023e2d01e4f9150c9?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kasim Shaik","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_561541949","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i03hyf:","customfield_10001":"2015-11-13T13:37:42.682-0600","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["kshaik(kshaik)","vasya(vasya)"],"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-11676/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/39225/comment/95717","id":"95717","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=vasya","name":"vasya","key":"vasya","accountId":"557058:1c63481a-0634-4ae7-9004-cb0f143e141f","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Vasiliy Kochergin","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~kshaik], could you provide some evidence that command supports only pv images?
