I want a single place where I can template my environment and import this into Eucalyptus.  I would then like to use a utility which works against this topology definition to synchronise keys to the relevant systems, e.g. euca-sync-keys. \r\n\r\nI believe this centralised method should expand on the loadable json as used for EDGE networking configuration in 4.0.\r\n\r\nThis centralised approach, rather than running multiple euca_conf commands has (or would have) the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- The registration of components to host mappings would be fully idempotent in its implementation.  This would be highly beneficial for users using configuration management and deployment automation to install Eucalyptus, allowing them to simply template a single file with hostname and component mappings and then load this into Eucalyptus.\r\n\r\n- In Eucalyptus 4, component separation and new services from previous releases mean that there are many components.  A single template would be more user friendly than running many (error prone) iterations of euca_conf commands.  \r\n\r\n- Retrieving the json would be useful for troubleshooting, since its a single record of what information was passed to the system about the topology.  Currently we must generally assume that euca_conf commands were run correctly unless we have shell history.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Idempotent component registration through json","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_102654660472","customfield_12100":"0|i02kzz:","customfield_10001":"2014-03-14T15:51:28.421-0500","customfield_10002":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10000","value":"Customer Affecting","id":"10000"}],"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["bcarpenter(bcarpenter)","lwade(lwade)","mcampbell(mcampbell)"],"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-8897/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/28058/comment/64744","id":"64744","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=bcarpenter","name":"bcarpenter","key":"bcarpenter","accountId":"557058:0d642857-0240-4c71-9ecc-a005f189a5c9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Ben Carpenter","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This would be a great upgrade to the current method of running various euca_conf [â€¦] commands.
