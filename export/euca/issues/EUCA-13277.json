Opening this as a bug and not an improvement because I believe this to be core functionality which is missing from the system.\r\nThanks!\r\n-M\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\n-We currently rely heavily on the installed package (and packaging mechanisms) for this information but on many occasions the installed software does not represent whats actually running. \r\n\r\n-Knowing what is running and where is one of the first and most valuable pieces of information needed when evaluating a given installation. This information provided in summary can help expedite time to resolution for field issues as well as in house development and test tasks. \r\n\r\n-In regards to collecting version information, the current methods for gathering this info are relatively cumbersome. The information may not accurately represent the running system. The information is difficult to share and compare (ie SOS reports). \r\n \r\n-Centralizing this information should be an MVP attribute of the system. This is core to managing and maintaining a distributed system of this type. The information needs to be made available per component first. \r\n \r\nSuggesting the following be reported by all components:\r\nMVP:\r\n- Eucalyptus version/release tag, relevant git information (commit hash, etc), date of build. \r\n- Any relevant version info of a given components dependencies (ie a running storage controller would version info for the Eucalyptus packages it depends on). \r\nNice to have(s):\r\n-When/where possible the system should report version information for 3rd party dependencies, backends, etc..\r\n-\"euca-describe-cloud\" type empyrean queries should present this info in a meaningful way to allow for a  simple, centralized, and common method for a user to retrieve this info. \r\n\r\n\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"All Eucalyptus components should report running version info","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mclark","name":"mclark","key":"mclark","accountId":"557058:9b68e4d6-90d8-47d3-9c86-519770009164","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mclark","name":"mclark","key":"mclark","accountId":"557058:9b68e4d6-90d8-47d3-9c86-519770009164","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_578976609_*|*_10001_*:*_1_*:*_8281300908","customfield_12100":"0|i0435b:","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["mclark(mclark)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-13277/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
