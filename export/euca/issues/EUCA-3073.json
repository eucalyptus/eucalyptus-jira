Some users are putting /var/lib/eucalyptus/volumes on an NFS share, iSCSI LUN etc.  In doing this, they create a new volumes directory in /var/lib/eucalyptus and they mount this at boot in fstab.  The issue here is that often the directory has the wrong owner when they do this (root).  This actually allows volumes to be created but volumes cannot be deleted, so once a user deletes a volume the volume file remains, taking up space etc.\r\n\r\nWe should check as part of SC startup procedures the volume permissions and report with error or warning. On top of this, if the SC is unable to delete the volume file, we should warn the administrator in logs or other alert mechanisms.\r\n\r\nTo replicate:\r\n\r\n(1) Change permissions of /var/lib/eucalyptus/volumes to be owned by root:root\r\n(2) Create a volume as normal user\r\n(3) As the cloud admin, check /var/lib/eucalyptus/volumes/ for the volume\r\n(4) Delete the volume, then delete again to remove from the euca-describe-volumes list\r\n(5) As the cloud admin, once again check /var/lib/eucalyptus/volumes/, see that the volume file still remains.\r\n(6) Rinse and repeat with correct ownership of volumes directory (eucalyptus:eucalyptus).  Notice that volume is actually deleted.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that an administrator can easily continue to run their cloud and later find a large number of volume files for non-existing EBS volumes taking up space.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mmunn1","name":"mmunn1","key":"mmunn1","accountId":"557058:6e62b7e8-e48f-469d-ac54-e9449dec5cd9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6638eee119e9c0bdcca16883c5415349?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmmunn1%26avatarId%3D11300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6638eee119e9c0bdcca16883c5415349?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmmunn1%26avatarId%3D11300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6638eee119e9c0bdcca16883c5415349?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmmunn1%26avatarId%3D11300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6638eee119e9c0bdcca16883c5415349?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmmunn1%26avatarId%3D11300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael
