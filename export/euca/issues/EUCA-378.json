The process can just finish. A port group is\nnot required before any operations of Eucalyptus. So I guess there is a need\nto differentiate the usual refresh() process and the sanity check during the\nregistration. They probably should have different ways to check the current\nstatus of the vmware hosts.\n\n  \nOn Sat Feb 05 11:39:15 2011, harold.spencer.jr wrote:\n\n> When using VMware Broker with direct connection to ESXi machine - if\n\n> there is\n\n> no virtual network created, \"euca_conf --configure-vmware\" will error\n\n> out.\n\n> Example from below:\n\n>\n\n> log4j:ERROR No appender named [] could be found.Please, supply vSphere\n\n> endpoint\n\n> URL: https://<ip address./sdkPlease, supply vSphere username:\n\n> rootPlease,\n\n> supply vSphere password:log4j:ERROR No output stream or file set for\n\n> the\n\n> appender named [null].ERROR: no vmware endpoints could be contacted\n\n> (check url,\n\n> login, and password)\n\n> The leads to the belief that VMware Broker can't communicate with the\n\n> ESXi\n\n> machine.
