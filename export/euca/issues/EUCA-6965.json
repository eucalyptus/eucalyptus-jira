Transfer and manipulation tasks\r\n\r\nThese tasks are largely intended for use inside Eucalyptus import and recycle pipelines, but should be ultimately usable via command-line tools if desired.\r\n\r\n* download bundle\r\n* unbundle image\r\n* mount image \r\n* unmount image\r\n* upload image - to system bucket, for use by hypervisor\r\n* bundle image\r\n* upload bundle\r\n* convert to canonical - converts, if necessary, into format acceptable to hypervisor from some number of formats (e.g., from VMDK into raw disk)\r\n* convert to vmdk - converts a raw disk into VMDK for upload to vSphere\r\n* upload to vsphere - uploads \r\n\r\nh5. Static validation tasks\r\n\r\nThese tasks are designed to run against a *mounted image*, either before importing an image into Eucalyptus or, inside the Eucalyptus import and recycling pipelines, prior to accepting the image as valid.\r\n\r\nh6. Linux image tasks\r\n\r\n* check /etc/fstab\r\n** no non-standard drives or partitions (input: block-device mapping)\r\n** no references to Xen device names\r\n* ensure acpiphp module is available\r\n* check udev net persistent\r\n* ensure SSHD will run\r\n* ensure cloud-init will run\r\n* ensure special system directories are not populated (places like proc, sysfs, devpts, debugfs, udevfs, cgroup, tmpfs, etc., which should not have real files in them)\r\n* ensure that not more than one Ethernet device is configured\r\n\r\nh6. Windows image tasks\r\n\r\n* ensure RDP will run\r\n* ensure EC2Config/sysprep will run\r\n* ensure VirtIO driver is installed (if hypervisor==KVM)\r\n\r\nh5. Dynamic validation tasks\r\n\r\nThese tasks are designed to run inside a system, either a Eucalyptus instance or a generic VM or a bare-metal OS. Some ensure that the running system is usable and is acceptable for immediate use in a Eucalyptus cloud. Others ensure that the running system is ready for being bundled for later import into a Eucalyptus cloud.\r\n\r\nh6. Linux system tasks\r\n\r\n* *post-boot checks* - to run against or inside an instance/VM soon after booting\r\n** instance is ping-able\r\n* *pre-bundle checks* - to run inside the instance before invoking bundle-vol\r\n** ensure the right paths are excluded (input: --exclude list for bundle-vol)\r\n** enough disk space for bundling the volume
