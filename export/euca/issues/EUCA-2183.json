G's comment\r\n\r\n\r\nDebugging instance launch failures takes a lot of time and we could implement some simple tools to make it easier. First, the admin has to figure out which node controller the instance landed on. This can often be done by using \"euca_conf --list-nodes | grep instance\" but there is currently a bug in that command so the instance ids don't always show up. Then you have to ssh to the right node and check out the log file.\r\n\r\nIt would be fantastic if an easier way to dig into the specific NC log file. Maybe gather the logs onto the CC machine so you can simply grep for the instance id. Other ideas?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=grangasamy","name":"grangasamy","key":"grangasamy","accountId":"557058:52f53a5f-b368-4eac-a2eb-7d0c9130c48a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/27e441f66ffef46ba1dd4d4487a0ecf1?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgrangasamy%26avatarId%3D10205%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/27e441f66ffef46ba1dd4d4487a0ecf1?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgrangasamy%26avatarId%3D10205%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/27e441f66ffef46ba1dd4d4487a0ecf1?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgrangasamy%26avatarId%3D10205%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/27e441f66ffef46ba1dd4d4487a0ecf1?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgrangasamy%26avatarId%3D10205%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"grangasamy","active":false,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2012-06-06T11:50:29.618-0500","updated":"2012-06-06T11:50:29.618-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/13216/comment/28679","id":"28679","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lbiasi","name":"lbiasi","key":"lbiasi","accountId":"557058:daaebf52-3713-4e4f-a29b-79f55aed32c9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Leslie Biasi","active":false,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"body":"This request has captured a Theme that surrounds troubleshooting and will be broken into multiple epics.
