Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~gholms], \r\nWhy this is advantageous to creating new creds:\r\n- Is relatively non-intrusive compared to creating a new keys. The state of the system remains the same. Creating new keys changes the state of the system, and depending on 'key limits' may have undesired consequences. Key limits can complicate and add an unknown cost to this. \r\n- This provides some of the functionality that exists in 'get-credentials' today that users have grown to rely upon. \r\n\r\nWhy this over a Unix Socket:\r\n- This (socket) seems  like a much more involved approach(ie ensuring/authorizing the source of this request/user ?), and might have the potential to introduce new security concerns. \r\n- Validating a user is root and local, afaik limits the potential harm to a user who already has access (or means) to access the cloud. This simply provides them a way to recover credentials in a convenient, non-intrusive manner. \r\n- This (socket) would also be a bit more to test I think :-)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-M \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mclark","name":"mclark","key":"mclark","accountId":"557058:9b68e4d6-90d8-47d3-9c86-519770009164","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-15T23:24:21.728-0500","updated":"2015-05-15T23:25:46.441-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
