after euca-register has useCount=0, and it can be marked as removable when all the other caches' useCount > 0.\n\nAfter several \"Maximum image cache size exceeded\" errors happened, I tried to run 3 instances from different images at the same time and 2 of them were terminated after long \"pending\" status.\nIt seemed that they were removing thier caches each other (see the log below) because all the other's useCount were 1.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n12:45:59  INFO [WalrusImageManager:Thread-81] Attempting to flush cached image:

removable.\n\nAlso it seems that the parameter useCount does not increase in normal run-instance proccess, but do increase where \"Maximum image cache size exceeded\" error happens.\nThis may cause an unreasonable result that the old unpopular cache with useCount=1 lives longer than a new popular cache with useCount=0.\nIs there some reason not to increase useCount in every run-instance process?\n\nthanks.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Strange
