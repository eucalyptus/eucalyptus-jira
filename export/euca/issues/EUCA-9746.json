As of 4.0, Eucalyptus ELB supports HTTPS/SSL.  It would be a nice additional security feature if we supported users being able to define the following:\r\n* [SSL security policy|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-security-policy-options.html] - to set SSL negotiations for the ELB\r\n* Server Order Preference - \r\n{quote}\r\nElastic Load Balancing supports the Server Order Preference for negotiating connections between the client and the load balancer. During the SSL connection negotiation process, the client and the load balancer present a list of ciphers and protocols that they each support, in order of preference. Normally, the first cipher on the client's list that matches any one of the load balancer's ciphers is selected for the SSL connection. If the load balancer is configured to support the Server Order Preference, then the load balancer gets to select the first cipher in its list that matches any one of the ciphers in the client's list. Server Order Preference ensures that the load balancer determines which cipher is used for SSL connection.\r\n{quote}","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Enable Support for SSL Negotiation Configurations for Elastic Load Balancing","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12100":"0|i02ty7:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_40156215126_*|*_10001_*:*_1_*:*_51313009989","customfield_10001":"2014-12-18T11:15:16.700-0600","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["hspencer(hspencer)"],"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-9746/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
