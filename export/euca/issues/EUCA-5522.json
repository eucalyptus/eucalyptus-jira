A: Eucalyptus uses DHCP to handle the private address/subnet management for VMs.  Due to the 'dynamic' nature of private networks (there are no 'fixed' static network => instance requirements in euca), the design around private addressing requires that an address => instance mapping is managed at run-time, dynamically, upon instance execution.  This is a different design from the more traditional \"configure the software with static network => VM mappings, and then they cannot change\".  The benefits are that the design permits more flexible network handling (changing subnets, mappings, recovery, etc at run-time) and has downsides which include the software having to automatically manage a DHCP daemon (for example).  All of the permissions questions asked here have one fundamental answer, which is 'the permission/ownership/location manipulation of DHCP files are as they are in order to allow a non-root process (eucalyptus CC) to be able to dynamically generate DHCP entries at run-time, and manage a DHCP daemon that is serving that dynamic content, in a distro neutral fashion.'  Charles went through some of the specifics referencing code, but that statement is the fundamental reason.  \r\n\r\nNOTE FOR FOLKS WORKING ON THIS IN THE FUTURE: two things have changed since the implementation that is in place was written.  First, we have narrowed the supported distros that the CC runs on.  Second, there is a ISC DHCP daemon API that may be more mature (usable) than it was previously.  This is worth looking into, if the current implementation has some technical limitations.\r\n\r\n2) Q: Why do we carry our own patched version of the DHCP daemon?  There was/is a bug in the standard ISC DHCP daemon that was introduced into the DHCP daemon packages that were pushed by Ubuntu and then later Centos/RHEL 6 about 6 months prior to 3.0.  When a single network interface has addresses assigned to it from multiple separate IP subnets, and those same subnets are defined in the DHCP configuration file, the daemon will only successfully serve one of them.  The daemon switched to a different method for querying addresses on interfaces that does not work.  I generated a patch that went upstream almost 1.5 years ago through Ubuntu, and I believe Garrett worked on pushing the patch up to Redhat as well.  I believe that someone mentioned recently that the latest CentOS (maybe fedora) had the patch included.  This is a fundamental requirement on how the CC operates (has always been), and we are carrying a patched version until the distros update their packages with a version that has the fix.\r\n\r\n3) Q: why does the manpage say this? \"Dhcpd can be made to use an alternate configuration file with the -cf flag, an alternate lease file with the -lf flag, or an alternate pid file with the -pf flag. Because of the importance of using the same lease database at all times when running dhcpd in production, these options should be used only for testing lease files or database files in a non-production environment.\".  I won't speak for the manpage author, but I believe that this sentiment is meant to prevent people from accidentally running multiple DHCP daemons *with overlapping configurations* on the same network.  Eucalyptus DHCP configuration is only applying static DHCP mappings for only eucalyptus managed VMs (mac addresses).  The only way there would be an 'accidental overlap' is if Eucalyptus is configured with a network space that is already in use by some other system on the network, or if some other system on the network is configured to use the address space that Eucalyptus has been configured to use.\r\n\r\nQ: Should we mention the packaging/use of DHCP daemon in the release notes?  I don't see why not.  Note a few things when drafting this content:\r\n  - I believe (check with the release team) that the the dhcp daemon we packages safely lives 'along side' the extant DHCP daemon (and as above, the configuration/leases/runtime stuff is all completely isolated).  There should not be any interference with the regular DHCP server/config.\r\n  - There was no change in Eucalyptus that necessesitated the need for carrying a patched DHCP daemon package.  Eucalyptus worked with the distro supported version for a long time, then it broke and was acknowledged as broken, and now it looks like it is getting fixed again at which point we will be able to drop the carrying of our own. \r\n\r\n-D","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=nurmi","name":"nurmi","key":"nurmi","accountId":"557058:68718820-f5e0-4305-a46c-f867a6bc9565","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Daniel Nurmi","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2013-04-02T11:20:23.831-0500","updated":"2013-04-02T11:21:16.110-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/20200/comment/43022","id":"43022","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Information to the questions in this issue have been provided.
