In this context, we have two kinds of users -- those that care about high availability and those that don't. For those that care about high availability, Scalable Object Storage in active/active configuration with RiakCS backend is the way to go. For others running in a much smaller scale, they have the option to use scalable object storage or go with a simple Walrus with a filesystem backed configuration.\r\n\r\nBeginning 4.0, I don't see a use case where Walrus with HA (DRBD; active/passive) will be useful. Do you agree? Further, would it make sense for us to deprecate Walrus + HA configuration?  What are the pros and cons? This ticket is meant to ask and address such questions.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/version/12806","id":"12806","description":"Eucalyptus 4.0.0","name":"4.0.0","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2014-05-30"}],"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Remove support for Walrus + HA","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=shashi","name":"shashi","key":"shashi","accountId":"557058:cc7ee5dc-1d4f-46c5-8068-6ae350275ba6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Shashi Mysore","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=shashi","name":"shashi","key":"shashi","accountId":"557058:cc7ee5dc-1d4f-46c5-8068-6ae350275ba6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Shashi Mysore","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i02inr:","customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_95107990_*|*_10001_*:*_1_*:*_106258232786","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["shashi(shashi)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-8628/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
