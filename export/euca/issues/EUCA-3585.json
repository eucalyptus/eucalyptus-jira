following error message\n\n{code}\nMon Sep 17 13:17:27 2012 ERROR [Hosts:pool-4-thread-25] [com.eucalyptus.bootstrap.Hosts$SetupRemoteServiceConfigurations.apply(Hosts.java):216]

fail-stopped.\n{code}\n\nWe really do not know what causes this fail-stopped on the CLC (running SC/CC/Walrus as well) after you rebooted the system without stopping the eucalyptus services and why we could not recover from this situation even after removing the database (used by CLC) and initialising it again. \n\nI hope this ticket would help us understand what is the actual cause of this error, what this error really means, how we can recover from such situation without having you to remove everything and setup eucalyptus from step 0 (install packages) and also from support stand point, what are the various ways we can land into this problem.\n\nThanks again for this issue and let us know if you have any questions.\n\nCheers!\nDeependra","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra
