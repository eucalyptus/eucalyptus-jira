We also opted to have it add partition tables and kernels and whatnot to images that were registered as paravirtual images to take that load off of the VMware broker.  This has a number of effects (and non-effects):\r\n\r\n# Instances of paravirtual images will not run until a lengthy conversion process finishes\r\n# RegisterImage/RunInstances is expected to be fast, whereas ImportVolume is expected to require processing time\r\n# The system must track the conversion state of each image, and, in turn, figure out how to expose that state to users\r\n# Load on node controllers is not decreased by the image conversion process, as the outputs of image conversion are still bundles\r\n# Node controllers still have to assemble disks themselves to accomodate varying kernel images and amounts of ephemeral storage\r\n# It adds a significant number of dependencies to basic instance-launching functionality\r\n# As we run more Eucalyptus services inside instances, the risk of circular dependencies increases\r\n# Effective image size is constrained by the amount of available disk space on imaging workers\r\n\r\nTo be clear, we should fix the imaging service's bugs regardless, but the basic RegisterImage/RunInstances process should not have to run through the imaging worker at all.  Now that the primary reason for doing so, VMware, is gone, we should revert that change and have imaging workers focus solely on import tasks.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=vasya","name":"vasya","key":"vasya","accountId":"557058:1c63481a-0634-4ae7-9004-cb0f143e141f","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Vasiliy
