Now with Eucalyptus 3.0 +, we model AWS behaviour in that users can upload their own kernel and ramdisk but cannot register them in the cloud for use.\r\n\r\nWe should look to provide an IAM extension which permits users to be able to register ramdisk and kernel, since we still require these and, other than bfEBS, don't support directly bootable images.\r\n  \r\nJustification:\r\n  \r\nAmazon only have one hypervisor to cater for (Xen) and historically they had\r\nto use pre-defined kernel and ramdisk to match dom0, so they kept these set in\r\nstone. As I understand, users can now user their own kernels with use of PV-\r\nGRUB, which allows for a little more flexibility. This model works for a\r\npublic cloud which uses a single hypervisor. In Eucalyptus, we potentially use\r\n3 different hypervisors and our customers are probably used to more\r\nflexibility, or require more flexibility in this area. I think that allowing\r\naccount admins to upload their own images AND kernel + ramdisk suits the\r\nprivate cloud model we aim for; account admins can use the best kernel and\r\nramdisk for their guests dependent on their hypervisor configuration, to\r\nmaximise performance and meet custom needs.\r\n  \r\nBenefit / Impact:\r\n  \r\nThis ensures the user experience is consistent with Eucalyptus 2.0, despite the new IAM model.\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-36","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Allow user to register kernel and initrd","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"customfield_12100":"0|i01eon:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_155432899519","customfield_10001":"2012-07-20T09:22:40.195-0500","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":["Account-Admin-PM"],"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_11600":["lwade(lwade)","mdlr(mdlr)","shashi(shashi)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/14116/comment/30029","id":"30029","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mdlr","name":"mdlr","key":"mdlr","accountId":"557058:29fd1eba-b820-4c8d-9228-0f52cb260d76","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/15f3c4b7a0cf758ddb400a37f09f0c86?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/15f3c4b7a0cf758ddb400a37f09f0c86?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/15f3c4b7a0cf758ddb400a37f09f0c86?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/15f3c4b7a0cf758ddb400a37f09f0c86?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael De La Rue","active":false,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Please note that booting KVM instances of RHEL with Grub has been tested and works with some limitations (e.g. console log doesn't work).
