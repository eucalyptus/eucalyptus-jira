accessible:\n\n\"Is there a workaround?\"\n\nUnfortunately none that I can think of; the issue here is providing the right\naccess rules across security groups which requires a lot of code change in\nthe way the CC sets up the sec. group policies (plus, and here is the really\ntricky part, if security groups come and go over time the entire network state\nwould need to be reconstructed!).\nEdge networking may include this support, but that is not slated for any\nrelease, yet.\nbest way around this is to just make sure that all security groups 'trust' all\nother security groups that a VM may be a part of (this gets you the same\naccess that running a VM in multiple security groups does). It is more\npermissive in that 'all' vms in any security group that trust one another will\nhave access to all others, but if you have a single VM that spans groups there\nis already a policy gateway between groups.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tjcramer","name":"tjcramer","key":"tjcramer","accountId":"557058:e076cf45-80ca-4b67-befb-7b0c21f32739","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tim Cramer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-19T10:49:28.887-0500","updated":"2013-03-19T10:49:28.887-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/14233/comment/71309","id":"71309","body":"This issue was previously scheduled to be worked on in more than one sprint:\r\n* '3.3 Sprint 4' (on board 'Test 3.3 Board')\r\n* '3.3 Sprint 4' (on board 'Copy of 3.3 Release Board')\r\n\r\nStarting from JIRA Agile 6.3, an issue can only belong to a single future sprint.
