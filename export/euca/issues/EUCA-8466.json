Concurrent log writes must be supported by multiple OSGs.\r\n\r\nS3 Spec: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html\r\n\r\nGeneral Design:\r\n\r\nOn each OSG do the following:\r\n* Record request events as defined by the S3 spec. \r\n* Using an async queuing mechanism, upload those records as entities to the DB.\r\n* Periodically,  look in the db table starting at the oldest by timestamp. Mark some records as 'leased' by this OSG and upload those as an object to the target bucket using the proper prefix and a uuid suffix on the object to ensure uniqueness. Delete the records from the db upon completion of the upload.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to remove the DB from the process if we discover too much overhead. The process may be lossy, that is okay as per S3 spec.\r\n\r\nImplementation MUST NOT:\r\n* Block request servicing on event upload to a bucket or any remote host. failing the logging event must not fail the user request.\r\n* Allow unbounded memory consumption in the OSG hosts regardless of DB connectivity or link latency. Again, dropping events must be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"EUCA-10396","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Add
