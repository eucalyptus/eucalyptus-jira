Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Do we really want to ask the user to delete objects because our cleanup routine is not completing within our arbitrary timeout period?\r\n\r\nI think a good compromise including your feedbacks (thanks!) is:\r\n\r\n# During the bucket reaper task, we can resolveBucketState for all buckets first (which should be fast, even with lots of buckets, regardless of number of objects), then cleanObjectHistoriesInBucket for as much time as remains in the timeout. So the history cleanup won't block bucket state cleanup.\r\n# Adding the warning as suggested (identifying the bucket and object it was on, when it was interrupted), \r\n# Raising the timeout to 10 minutes, running every 20 minutes. That gives it 20x the time to clean up. \r\n\r\nOutside this task: A bucket creation waits for 60 seconds before giving up anyway, independently of this task. A bucket deletion normally happens right away, so users should rarely have to wait for this reaper to run before seeing a bucket as deleted; having to clean this up usually indicates a failed deletion. So extending the period for resolveBucketState doesn't seem too bad, since normal operation isn't blocked by this task.\r\n\r\nWe can do any or all of the above.\r\n\r\nThis is a small change set, see:\r\nhttps://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/pull/109\r\n(Certain log messages temporarily raised from Trace to Info for testing only, or newly added as Info and will become Trace)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-07-18T21:42:08.028-0500","updated":"2017-07-18T21:58:46.093-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/60502/comment/125400","id":"125400","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tony","name":"tony","key":"tony","accountId":"557058:353956db-b78c-4f3b-9096-f8f58e6709c8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tony Beckham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"[~lincoln.thomas], the thinking was that even extending the timeout would not allow cleanup to complete in the case of millions of objects.

In some cases there could be objects stored that are not needed and in this case deleting them is reasonable. I agree it is not reasonable to expect all users to delete objects to address this issue.\r\n\r\nPerforming resolveBucketState first for all buckets sounds good. The only potential issue is that if you have many buckets this would mean you would never perform cleanObjectHistoriesInBucket for any buckets. We might want to log a specific warning if this timeout during resolveBucketState processing occurs. Ideally we would use a random bucket order here to mitigate any potential timeout issues. I would not log processing each bucket at INFO level as there could be many buckets.\r\n\r\nI don't know how many objects are processed currently (30 second timeout) or how many would be processed with a 10 minute timeout. We should test to ensure that our changes address the issue as it is not clear what the benefit is of making those changes otherwise. If we log how many objects have been processed when a timeout occurs then this should be easy to evaluate.\r\n\r\nI would not change the default timing for the task in 4.4.2 if it causes any behavioural differences (I'm not aware of any) or if it does not address the issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-07-19T12:20:14.160-0500","updated":"2017-07-19T12:20:14.160-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/60502/comment/125403","id":"125403","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Testing results overnight with the changed code:\r\n* 1,000 buckets, 1 object in each bucket (1,000 objects), resolveBucketState took <1 second, and cleanObjectHistoriesInBucket took 6 seconds.\r\n* 10,000 buckets, and 5 objects per bucket (50,000 objects), resolveBucketState still took <1 second, and cleanObjectHistoriesInBucket took 2 min 54 sec.\r\n(Note the default limit is 100 buckets per account.

Committed now.\r\n\r\nh3. Test results:\r\n\r\nh4. 1st deployment\r\nSame deployment used in earlier test results here, 8GB machines, CLC / UFS / Walrus all on separate nodes: (VPC)\r\n\r\nUploaded 855,000 objects to one \"bigbucket\" with \"aws s3 sync\" in 19.4 hours.\r\n\r\nStill resolved all buckets states in <1 sec\r\n\r\nUsing a hour timeout for testing, cleaning object records (mostly from bigbucket) timed out after cleaning 359,000 objects, those from bigbucket took 58m 49s = 101 obj/sec\r\nSo, orig 30 sec at avg 200 obj/s means you can have 6,000 objs in one bucket max (with not much in other buckets) if you want it to complete.\r\n10 min = 120,000 objs\r\n15 min = 180,000 objs\r\n\r\nh4. 2nd deployment:\r\n\r\nBuilt new quick launch w/ my branch, Edge, 64GB RAM machines, default topology with CLC and UFS+Walrus nodes, concise regression passed.\r\n\r\nCreated 50,000 buckets, 2 obj in each, and 1 bigbucket with 100,000 objects. The bigbucket finished populating (with aws sync) before object finished populating in the other buckets.\r\n\r\nAfter 3,700 buckets populated (2 obj each) so far, so 7% of the existing 50,000 buckets having 2 objects, but with fully populated bigbucket, cleaning took 4.8 min to complete. (buckets still resolved in <1 sec).\r\n4.8m = 288s = 347 obj/s, 3.5x the other deployment. (topology differences?)\r\n\r\nAdded another 100,000 objs to bigbucket. Stopped populating the other 50,000 buckets after 35,500 populated overnight. So 70% of them had 2 objs, the other 30% had zero. Total 135,500 objects.\r\n\r\nFinished resolving bucket states in <2 sec.\r\nFinished cleanups after 15 minutes (timed out). \r\nCleaned 200,000 objects in bigbucket in 10.3m = 323 obj/s, so a linear time increase with more objects. It timed out cleaning the other 50,000 buckets, but it had cleaned them \r\n\r\nSo, depending on your topology, a 15min timeout would allow at least a 180,000-object bucket to complete (~300,000 on the faster topology), which meets the 100,000 object target desired. This is also in the presence of the target 50,000 buckets, with 0-2 objects in each (it timed out doing the other buckets).\r\n\r\nI got the desired Warnings when it timed out.\r\nI've committed the code with the 15 minute timeout, running every 30 minutes. Feel free to change it if desired.\r\n\r\n_Note: The bucket that it warns about, when it times out, may not be the bucket that has the most objects. For example, I saw this once:_\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nFri Jul 21 11:55:05 2017  WARN [BucketReaperTask:QuartzScheduler_Worker-3] Timed out while cleaning up object records in bucket uuid 901c9dac-03d2-4ca7-a504-039738223116, name buckettest34500 after processing 2 objects.\r\nFri Jul 21 11:55:05 2017  WARN [BucketReaperTask:QuartzScheduler_Worker-3] Timed out while cleaning up object records after processing 41473 buckets.\r\nFri Jul 21 11:55:05 2017  WARN [BucketReaperTask:QuartzScheduler_Worker-3] Timed out while cleaning up object records after processing 41473 buckets.\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n(The double Warning is because of multiple places in the code it could be logged, depending on variable checks vs. interrupted threads, maybe could be optimized but not a big deal IMHO)\r\nThe bigbucket finished within the timeout, but it timed out while doing all the other 50,000 buckets. This one only had 2 objects in it. But it's more likely that a bucket with lots of objects will be the one it shows. Also, buckets are processed randomly, so if it consistently times out, you'll see Warnings after each run, more likely being the ones with larger numbers of objects, so you can let it run to see what buckets pop up.\r\n\r\nClosed pull request https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/pull/109 (temporary, several commits for testing) and opened and merged new squashed pull request https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/pull/110\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-07-21T14:31:03.114-0500","updated":"2017-07-21T14:34:47.925-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/60502/comment/125509","id":"125509","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The changes currently in QA for this issue look good to me overall. I think further changes are are required for the timing aspect.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are two different settings for the timing of this cleanup task. The first is the scheduler configuration for the task interval for which the default value is in the code, but the value actually used is from the database. The second setting is the timeout configured in the task (code) itself. These settings have to be changed together to get reasonable behaviour and currently on upgrade I think you would get new settings for the task timeout, but not for the scheduler which (I assume) would mean you could end up with 15 concurrently running cleanup tasks.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-07-24T12:08:44.642-0500","updated":"2017-07-24T12:08:44.642-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/60502/comment/125709","id":"125709","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The timing of the task is reverted to very minute and and all object storage gateway tasks are updated so that they do not run concurrently.

This means that you could change the task interval to 1 hour (for example) by updating the db schedule, this is not recommended, particularly if you have more than one object storage gateway.\r\n\r\nWith the settings reverted there should be no user visible functionality change on upgraded systems other than logging if a timeout occurs and that bucket state is processed first on each task run.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-07-27T17:28:34.680-0500","updated":"2017-07-27T17:28:34.680-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/60502/comment/126002","id":"126002","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"LGTM.
