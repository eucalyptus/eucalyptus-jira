We currently believe that a) customers are generally unable or unwilling to open the firewall for this and b) vendors have not generally designed their applications to draw from private clouds. These are not universal, just common.\r\n\r\nThe API(s) is required because it will enable Eucalyptus users to more easily tie usage / cost reports into the systems they use for showback / chargeback / general reporting. Note that we also expect users who subscribe to a cloud cost monitoring service to regularly grab these reports and upload the data to their vendor.\r\n\r\nCritically important is the format of the data that comes back from these API calls. I will attach separately a billing report.

Dyess","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Shashi and I separately discussed the challenge of determining what price a user should assign to the different resources. During that discussion we agreed that it's not necessary for Eucalyptus to define the pricing for each user, but instead give them instructions on where / how to set the pricing. Users would be free to, for example, set private instances of m1.large as .01 or 5.23.\n\nBasically imagine Eucalyptus ships with a default JSON file for each of the pricing endpoints. The user tweaks out each file as needed. When a API (simple GET) call is made, the appropriate JSON file is served up.\n\nAlso, we understand that Eucalyptus does not yet support all instance types or things like spot instances. I suggest we include the JSON file and API for them anyhow just to be complete. Again, the user can set whatever values they want.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucacolby","name":"eucacolby","key":"eucacolby","accountId":"557058:2399a28c-111f-487f-a7c3-c97d4afe7520","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Colby
