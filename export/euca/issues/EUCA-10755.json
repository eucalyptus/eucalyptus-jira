This is definitely a bug but it may not be a blocker for upgrade in my opinion. My understanding is that all EBS instances should be stopped and instance store instances should be terminated prior to the upgrade. This is necessary as the NC's instance processing logic may have changed and there is a risk of loosing instances as it happened in the above case. [~tony], correct me if I'm wrong on that. Can you please try stoping the instance prior to the upgrade, run the upgrade and then start the instance?\r\n\r\nI would recommend testing the above use case first before trying to introduce a code change at this point.

If that seems to be the case, we can open a different ticket and work on that issue separately","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=swathi","name":"swathi","key":"swathi","accountId":"557058:ab7e71b5-781c-49ea-9f4d-ea9148c88f03","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Swathi Gangisetty","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-22T17:42:07.264-0500","updated":"2015-04-22T17:42:07.264-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/35805/comment/85527","id":"85527","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tony","name":"tony","key":"tony","accountId":"557058:353956db-b78c-4f3b-9096-f8f58e6709c8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tony Beckham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"This issue is verified.\r\n\r\nUpgraded 4.0.2 to 4.1.1 with stopped instance and instance was able to start after upgrade.\r\n\r\nInstalled Packages\r\nName        : eucalyptus\r\nArch        : x86_64\r\nVersion     : 4.1.1\r\nRelease     : 0.0.23201.85.20150422git247db2b.el6\r\n\r\nInstance stopped prior to upgrade can be started after.
