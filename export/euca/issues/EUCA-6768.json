server.  \n\nMore info...\nAt this point I do not think this will need Engineering work to achieve. Our current plan is to create a set of base  images without any Eucalyptus specific software and install Cygwin for ssh (if needed). We will likely have a separate story to track the next steps involving creating Eucalyptus tool'd images from these base images. \n\nSome background on the SSH portion...\nWe are attempting to improve our current Windows QA env by:\n-eliminating debug and failure points, \n-reusing test code that is not 'Windows' specific, \n-expedite testing, debugging, and development of 'Windows Guest tests' in Eucalyptus. \n\nWe have been investigating SSH, Telnet, and Powershell. \n\nQA currently uses Power shell to do the majority of our Windows testing, however we execute most of the Powershell from a Linux server via ssh.   \nLike Eucalyptus, our automated tests/test environment runs on Linux. We currently use an 'ssh to power shell' proxy to test windows. This involves a Linux server executing a test against a Linux cloud that is running a Windows Guest, the Linux server is executing power shell commands/scripts on a remote windows server to then test the remote Windows guest. Most of these tests are also using SSH to the Eucalyptus components to query status, provide debug information, or execute the non-Windows Guest specific portion of the tests. Querying the Linux portion of the system via SSH is often the majority of the test, and test development. \n\nI have been unable to find a decent way to run remote Powershell from a Linux server, and so far Cygwin seems to provide the best environment for the SSH portion on Windows. \n\nThanks,\n-M\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mclark","name":"mclark","key":"mclark","accountId":"557058:9b68e4d6-90d8-47d3-9c86-519770009164","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-30T23:27:07.815-0500","updated":"2013-06-30T23:27:07.815-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/22192/comment/49201","id":"49201","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"To add to [~mclark] comments, one motivation to package cygwin/sshd with the windows tool was to enable eutester with windows VM (possibly for use by customers).

If so, why not use the Active Directory server to be the driver for the tests?  From what I have seen in the field, anyone deploying a Windows instance has it tied to Active Directory if they are running the instances in production.\n\nRegarding adding a cygwin/sshd package that can be installed with the Windows Integration Tool - anyone who is running a Windows instance in production won't have cygwin and/or SSHD enabled.  Unfortunately, if you are doing Windows in production, you are all in (i.e. do everything the Windows way).  IMO, if we can have a set of PowerShell scripts that we can use, and share with customers, this will help improve our Windows support story tremendously.  \n\nI understand the case for making it easier for QA testing, but don't we want to test what customers will do?  I know it may seem like an extra step (and dependency), but wouldn't it help us in the long run if we are able to test what customers will do in production?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-07-01T09:38:22.202-0500","updated":"2013-07-01T09:38:22.202-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/22192/comment/49216","id":"49216","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mclark","name":"mclark","key":"mclark","accountId":"557058:9b68e4d6-90d8-47d3-9c86-519770009164","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The need for 'Linux' remote access is to optimize automated QA. \nAdding a set of desired points on the solution.

This is also a good reason to have a separate debugging method for QA which has little to no reliance upon AD. \n\n [~spark] has done a good job of creating a test environment that does pretty much everything in a 'Windows' way. We hope to continue using most of this and adding to it. However, even in this current env cygwin SSH is still installed on a Windows server acting as a proxy and ssh is in the test path. The Powershell scripts can be executable directly in Windows  w/o ssh though. They will lose the benefit of interrogating or exercising actions on the entire Linux system (ie Eucalyptus) concurrently  via ssh though.  \n \nOur test scripts (including the powershell scripts) should be available with our test suites.  If they are not I'll post them to Eutester. Currently the Windows test env requires a HW component(s) including an ssh proxy and AD server(s) with static configuration so they may not be that useful/portable outside of our env. \nI agree there is a lot of value in testing actual use cases. Time and licensing allowing, some additional 'dog-food-ish' use cases would be good.

Just wondered if the interaction once you ssh'd into the Windows machine was similar to what you would see on a Linux machine (I did this a long time ago, and I am not sure if the behavior changed or not)?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-07-02T13:08:07.254-0500","updated":"2013-07-02T13:08:07.254-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/22192/comment/49256","id":"49256","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~hspencer] we have not tested Linux wmi client.

At least this will be a manual effort.  \n\n[~dfederlein]  Thanks. I've been following PASH for long time now (~2 years) waiting to see if the project would be revived. It looked pretty much dead until very recently. Looks like there's some recent activity in the project. Would be awesome if/when PASH becomes stable, that would be ideal. I'll take it out for another test drive. \n\nRe remote pshell...\nWe currently use remote Powershell through a proxy, and as mentioned before this still requires cygwin on Windows and SSH.  This adds an unnecessary point of failure and maintenance given our Linux based automated test environment, also makes the tests/test env a bit less portable. We  plan to continue to use Powershell so assuming we'll be ready to support remote Powershell via Windows, and/or with something like PASH when/if it's ready and stable without needing to rebuild our test images.\n\nWanted to note that during investigation of all these tools, many blogs do mention ssh as a viable alternative for 'Linux driven remote Windows access' to the tool(s) in discussion. I'm hoping to build this latest base set of 'test' images so that use of ssh now should not prevent us from developing tests which utilize other remote access methods in the future. \nBig thanks for this discussion!\n-M\n\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mclark","name":"mclark","key":"mclark","accountId":"557058:9b68e4d6-90d8-47d3-9c86-519770009164","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-07-03T12:56:06.610-0500","updated":"2013-07-03T12:56:06.610-0500"}],"maxResults":17,"total":17,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-6768/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
