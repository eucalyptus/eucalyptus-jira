Every engineer who needed cloud resources was able to procure them at the click of a button.  This led to an increase in resource usage and allowed us to move more quickly as an organization.  At the same time, seeing the big picture of how many resources were used and by whom became more difficult. In addition, Netflix is a highly decentralized environment where each service team decides how many resources their services need.  The elastic nature of the cloud make capacity planning less crucial and teams can simply add resources as needed.  Viewing the broad picture of cloud resource usage becomes more difficult in such an environment.  To address both needs, Netflix created Ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIce provides a birds-eye view of our large and complex cloud landscape from a usage and cost perspective.  Cloud resources are dynamically provisioned by dozens of service teams within the organization and any static snapshot of resource allocation has limited value.  The ability to trend usage patterns on a global scale, yet decompose them down to a region, availability zone, or service team provides incredible flexibility. Ice allows us to quantify our AWS footprint and to make educated decisions regarding reservation purchases and reallocation of resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are thrilled to announce that today Ice joins the NetflixOSS platform.  You can get the source code on GitHub at
