tell people doing administration tasks to point their clients at localhost on their CLCs and rely on redirects to route requests appropriately, but esi-install-image sends larger requests like S3 PUTs that become problematic when no OSG runs on the CLC.  After the web service stack reads the first chunk from the request's channel and finds no pipeline to handle it it sends a 307 redirect response to the channel and immediately schedules that channel to be closed.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is racy -- if the client doesn't read from that connection in time it will see the socket simply close without a response from the service.  In most cases that won't matter since requests usually fit into one chunk, but PUTs to OSGs are large enough for this to be a problem, breaking clients that don't support 100-continue exchanges for whatever reason.  (e.g. most anything written in python)\r\n\r\nS3 delays connection closure for a period of time and simply discards whatever data one uploads in order to give one a chance to read its response.  That period of time was 10 seconds, though I believe it recently changed.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jhalterman","name":"jhalterman","key":"jhalterman","accountId":"557058:4cd5b16c-c831-4dae-acbc-1e26350c87f3","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4b515b5c070734d54b5c1839c9e01910?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djhalterman%26avatarId%3D17200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4b515b5c070734d54b5c1839c9e01910?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djhalterman%26avatarId%3D17200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4b515b5c070734d54b5c1839c9e01910?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djhalterman%26avatarId%3D17200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4b515b5c070734d54b5c1839c9e01910?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djhalterman%26avatarId%3D17200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jonathan

as the client trying an operation and getting socket closed, then retrying a few times. The server side is clearly sending 403s, 307s, etc but due to this behavior the client never sees the response. This has caused us lots of debugging and support problems because often the issue is a config problem on the client causing 403s but they never see the response.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly bad client
