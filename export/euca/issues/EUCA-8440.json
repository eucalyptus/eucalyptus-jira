This will require a redesign of how Bucket logging is implemented as the Walrus implementation required direct file access to the objects that stored the logs (to append to them).\r\n\r\nThe implementation must: \r\nAllow arbitrary writers (OSGs) without losing/overwriting log events.\r\nSupport any backend for the OSG.\r\nPreserve the performance and reliability of the OSG (not OOM or wait on log even delivery)\r\n\r\nImplementation options: update shared objects but use conditions on the upload to ensure that they haven't changed since retrieved by each OSG. The \"append\" process here is: fetch log object, append entries, upload if not changed (etag match with current object).\r\n\r\nAn alterative is for each OSG to have a unique log name prefix such that there are no conflicts between OSGs and each just writes its own objects. This more scalable, robust, and simpler, but could result in lots of little log files if each OSG only has a little bit of log data (due to load-balancing, for example).\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"EUCA-6603","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Support Bucket logging in OSG+RiakCS","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i02erz:","customfield_10000":"10001_*:*_1_*:*_33226_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_7570566768_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10004":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["zhill(zhill)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-8440/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
