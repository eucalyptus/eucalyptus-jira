When going across AZ, the NATing occurs at the source CC and the filtering will occur later at the destination CC.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Authorizing a group in another opens up public IP access within a single AZ","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=chuck","name":"chuck","key":"chuck","accountId":"557058:95e4b012-7cd1-4fd1-995d-eba573d35653","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Chuck","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=chuck","name":"chuck","key":"chuck","accountId":"557058:95e4b012-7cd1-4fd1-995d-eba573d35653","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Chuck","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_10000":"10000_*:*_1_*:*_459897938_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12100":"0|i02ykn:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["chuck(chuck)"],"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-10087/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
