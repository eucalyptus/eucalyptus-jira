that when switching the AWS regions and receiving all AWS images causes significant memory leak on the browser -- Chrome in my case.\r\n\r\nThe initial memory usage of the UI, when logged, on was 7.2 MB. Upon the first viewing of the all AWS images on the region Oregon jumped the memory to be 65.8 MB. When switched over to N.California, it was at 107 MB, then going back to Oregon's image page caused the memory to go up to 155 MB. Repeating back and forth between Oregon and California, the memory size continuously goes up to 210 MB, 257 MB, etc.\r\n\r\nPlus, another thing to notice is the number of the objects held by the browser, which was reached to 1.3 million objects with 1.0 million items in arrays. It is known that Firefox is not good at handling such a large size of arrays and strings.\r\n\r\nIn order to see the memory usage of the UI:\r\n\r\n1. Open the UI on Chrome and log into AWS.\r\n2. Open the Developer's tools on Chrome.\r\n3. Select the profiles view on the Developer's tools\r\n4. Perform the initial \"Take Heap Snapshot\" action to measure the initial memory usage.\r\n5.
