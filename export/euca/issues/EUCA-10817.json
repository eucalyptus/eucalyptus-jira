Since we maintain and ship eucalyptus on a per-x.y-series basis and we seem to have no qualms about making backwards-incompatible changes to the database in z-stream releases upgrades can be onerous more frequently than we might hope.\r\n\r\nIt currently works this way for a multitude of reasons:  the database upgrade process's dependence on an enum that only tracks eucalyptus software versions, deferring persistence layer automagic to runtime, and so on.  Regardless, requiring one to step an entire cloud through several eucalyptus z-stream versions just to upgrade it after several months of operation presents a bad user experience and makes the upgrade process excessively lengthy.  Eucalyptus should be able to automatically do whatever data migration it needs to do for several versions in
