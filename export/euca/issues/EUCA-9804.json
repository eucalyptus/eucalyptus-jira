These options will probably go away later.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n-Dcloudformation.use_swf=true (to use SWF instead of Glisten local mode)\r\n\r\nNote:  There is currently an issue in SWF that doesn't allow more than one Workflow Type to be polling simultaneously.  For that reason, there are two options that are definitely temporary.\r\n\r\n-Dcloudformation.suppress_swf_create=true (will use Glisten local mode for create even if SWF is enabled)\r\n\r\n-Dcloudformation.suppress_swf_delete=true (will use Glisten local mode for delete even if SWF is enabled)\r\n\r\nThis allows for testing of each of the create/delete stack calls while the issue with simultaneous workflows is still in place.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a known issue that sometimes the workflows will get stuck, usually in the final step.  For example, a stack may be deleted, but still show up at DELETE_COMPLETE in the describe-stacks command (the stack should disappear from that list).
