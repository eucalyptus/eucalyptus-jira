Total ordering is currently /not/ optional.  \n\nDef. Correctness: In the absence of node failures, admission of a\nresource allocation request for vm resources of time t0 (call the\nquantity R_t0) is \"correct\" if R_t0 is less than or equal to the number\nof resources available in the system after performing the allocations of\nall R_ti for ti < t0\n\nDef. Conservative: A correct resource allocator for which R_t0 is\nstrictly less than the number of resources available in the system after\nperforming the allocations of all R_ti for ti < t0\n\nIt is possible to show that for a \"correct\" resource allocator servicing\nmore than two vm-types one of the following two must be true:\n1. vm types are totally ordered\n2. resource allocations are serialized and synchronous\n\nThis is left as an exercise to the reader.  A corrolary of #2 is that\nall resource modifying (not just allocating) requests would need to be\nserialized and synchronous.

Corresponding adjust made in euca2ools\r\n    and included here are for the console and autoscaling.\r\n    \r\n    Type ordering restriction is relaxed in the following way:\r\n    - Instance types are not /required/ to be partial ordered\r\n    - Instances types which are /not/ partially ordered are\r\n      treated as a degenerate case.\r\n    - The system determines the set of partially ordered types\r\n      and as long as run-instance requests during a duty cycle\r\n      only refer to ordered types the system behaves as it did\r\n      before.\r\n    - Should an unordered type be requested, or be inflight when\r\n      any other run-instance request arrives, the request will\r\n      be preceded by and immediately followed by a CC downcall\r\n      to update resource state information.  Note that only the\r\n      preceding resource state update happens synchronously.\r\n    - The state updates must happen whenever there is an as-yet-\r\n      unfulfilled request that references an unordered type.\r\n      Otherwise, the ordered type resource accounting is skewed.\r\n    - Below is a script for computing the set of conflicting or\r\n      unordered instance types and could serve as the basis for\r\n      future enhancement to tighten up resource accounting and\r\n      perhaps allow removing the synchronous special case update.\r\n    \r\n    This functionality supercedes the previous approach using\r\n    'euca-describe-availability-zones verbose' which will be\r\n    deprecated in a subsequent release.\r\n    \r\n    The following tickets are addressed\r\n    - EUCA-442  instance types can be set out of order\r\n    - EUCA-6018 persisting changes to instance types\r\n    - EUCA-5915 IAM policy checking\r\n    - EUCA-5968 modification of instance types in the admin ui\r\n    - EUCA-6041 upgrading of instances types using old values\r\n    - EUCA-6042 adjust operation and parameter naming to prefer instance to vm\r\n    - EUCA-6095 changes in admin ui are saved properly\r\n    - EUCA-4529 api for retrieving instance type information\r\n    - EUCA-3635 non-ui method for modifying instance types\r\n    - EUCA-3056 instance types can be set out of order\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=decker","name":"decker","key":"decker","accountId":"557058:518b1ab0-12c2-4e72-b694-6c07036941a8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"do not want!
