are divergences between the implementation and the documentation.\n- at least one as-yet-unexplained instance of image corruption.\n- the guestfish CLI utility is useful for interactively exploring images, though IMO not appropriate for scripted use.\n- the Python API appears to be useful for doing specific, relatively simple tasks such as file injection in a secure way. (The C API would also be useful, though more work to use.)\n- the FUSE interface should be useful for doing more involved tasks, such as image validation, in a somewhat less secure way than the API (due to the FUSE mount), though more securely than by directly mounting images. This could be done from Python or shell (or C).\n- the Augeas configuration API could be useful for doing configuration-file parsing and editing, though so far I've mostly found it confusing.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=juphoff","name":"juphoff","key":"juphoff","accountId":"557058:c2c52741-c1d7-497e-87c9-57845be682d0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jeff Uphoff","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-07-30T16:00:01.329-0500","updated":"2013-07-30T16:00:01.329-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-7004/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
