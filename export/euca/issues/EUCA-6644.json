This would be really helpful when recovering from an instance outage that had volumes attached.\r\n\r\n*Description*\r\n\r\nDescribes the status of one or more volumes. Volume status provides the result of the checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the performance of your volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, once the system is restored there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event.\r\n\r\nThe DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:\r\n\r\n* Status: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok, impaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the status is insufficient-data, then the checks may still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend you retry the request. For more information on volume status, see Monitoring the Status of Your Volumes.\r\n\r\n* Events: Reflect the cause of a volume status and may require you to take an action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired status, then the volume event might be potential-data-inconsistency. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and may have inconsistent data.\r\n\r\n* Actions: Reflect the actions you may have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency, then the action will show enable-volume-io. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency.\r\n\r\n_Note_\r\n* Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the error state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Implement
