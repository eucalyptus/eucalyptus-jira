Addressing (DHCP server).\n   Move from CC to NCs (due to interaction with #2 below).\n2. Keep VM networks isolated from each other (VLAN tagging). <- Tied to #1.\n   Edge means this needs to be removed.\n3. Layer 3 isolation (security-group rules): iptables, user-controllable fire-walling.\n   Need to transmit user-set security-group rules from CC to NC. (NC needs this\n   information to implement iptables at edge.)\n4. Elastic IPs. (Sort of the same as #3--all interactions with iptables.)\n   Must assign real addresses to physical machines.\n   (assign address/unassign address)\n\nCC is network gateway for instances. Need to be able to set gateways at NCs/VMs.\n\nHow to do this with VMware? <- Beyond tech-preview scope.\n\nInvestigate start/stop network, assign/unassign address.\n{quote}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=juphoff","name":"juphoff","key":"juphoff","accountId":"557058:c2c52741-c1d7-497e-87c9-57845be682d0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jeff Uphoff","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-06-19T12:12:46.966-0500","updated":"2013-06-19T12:12:46.966-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/21591/comment/47845","id":"47845","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=juphoff","name":"juphoff","key":"juphoff","accountId":"557058:c2c52741-c1d7-497e-87c9-57845be682d0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/11a22041bb5fb0250638e57dc0ddf8c5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djuphoff%26avatarId%3D10503%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jeff Uphoff","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Further networking sync meetings scheduled.
