We should use dnsperf with the cname to make sure a large number of concurrent and continuing queries continue to be served.\r\n\r\nTo test EUCA-10626, set up one or more # of VMs and run dnsperf (each with concurrency) simultaneously against CLC. 2 things to look at: \r\n   -- whether/when CLC times out the query. At what amount of workload, it starts time-out.\r\n   -- after the timeout phase, CLC gets back to normal quickly (within a few seconds).\r\n\r\nTo test EUCA-9776, make sure CLC returns small number of SERVFAIL for the example query list.\r\n\r\nI believe test for EUCA-10626 would cover EUCA-8633.
