Obviously, though, it means that other things done by that service are turned off too.  By default this would be confusing (the instance has one name; inside the host it looks like there is a different instance ID).  Users should be recommended to rename their windows hosts to something sensible and different from the instance name straight after the first boot and before doing AD integration or application installs.  \n\nAlso Lester suggests using a registry key.
