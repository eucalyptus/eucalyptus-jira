Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Per [AWS documentation|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/PreparingYourVirtualMachine.html], they recommend the following:\r\n\r\n*Windows*\r\n\r\n* Enable Remote Desktop (RDP) for remote access.\r\n* Make sure that your host firewall (Windows firewall or similar), if configured, allows access to RDP. Otherwise, you will not be able to access your instance after the import is complete.\r\n* *Make sure that the administrator account and all other user accounts use secure passwords. All accounts must have passwords or the importation might fail.*\r\n* Make sure that your Windows VM has .NET Framework 3.5 installed, as required by [Amazon Windows EC2Config Service|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html].\r\n* Do not run System Preparation (Sysprep) on your Windows VM images. We recommend that you import the image and then use the [Amazon EC2 Config service to run Sysprep|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html].\r\n* Disable Autologon on your Windows VM.\r\n* Make sure that there are no pending Microsoft updates, and that the computer is not set to install software when it reboots.\r\n\r\n*Linux*\r\n\r\n* Enable Secure Shell (SSH) for remote access.\r\n* Make sure that your host firewall (such as Linux iptables) allows access to SSH. Otherwise, you will not be able to access your instance after the import is complete.\r\n* *Make sure that you have configured a non-root user to use public key-based SSH to access your instance after it is imported. The use of password-based SSH and root login over SSH are both possible, but not recommended. The use of public keys and a non-root user is recommended because it is more secure. VM Import will not configure an ec2-user account as part of the import process.*\r\n* Make sure that your Linux VM uses GRUB (GRUB legacy) or GRUB 2 as its bootloader.\r\n* Make sure that your Linux VM uses a root filesystem is one of the following: EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, Btrfs, JFS, or XFS.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, it looks like you have to set the admin password, then after installing the EC2Config service tool, enable the option to keep the existing password or specify a password.  Options for the EC2Config service for setting the administrator password are as follows:\r\n\r\n* *Random* —EC2Config generates a password, encrypts it with user's key, and displays the encrypted password to the console. We disable this setting after the first launch so that this password persists if the instance is rebooted or stopped and started.\r\n* *Specify* —The password is stored in the Sysprep answer file in unencrypted form (clear text). When Sysprep runs next, it sets the Administrator password. If you shut down now, the password is set immediately. When the service starts again, the Administrator password is removed. It's important to remember this password, as you can't retrieve it later.\r\n* *Keep Existing* —The existing password for the Administrator account doesn't change when Sysprep is run or EC2Config is restarted. It's important to remember this password, as you can't retrieve it later.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can add this as an improvement/new feature to the Windows Integration Tool (EUCA-5553)?\r\n\r\nI do think there is some value with passing a keypair when importing an instance.  This way, when the instance is started, access can be granted using the keypair.
