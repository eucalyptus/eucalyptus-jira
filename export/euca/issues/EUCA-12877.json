The following events can be published (that apply to Eucalyptus):\r\n* A new object created event—Amazon S3 supports multiple APIs to create objects. You can request notification when only a specific API is used (e.g., {{s3:ObjectCreated:Put}}) or you can use a wildcard (e.g., {{s3:ObjectCreated:*}}) to request notification when an object is created regardless of the API used.\r\n* An object removal event—Amazon S3 supports deletes of versioned and unversioned objects. For information about object versioning, see Object Versioning and Using Versioning.\r\nYou can request notification when an object is deleted or a versioned object is permanently deleted by using the {{s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete}} event type. Or you can request notification when a delete marker is created for a versioned object by using {{s3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated}}. You can also use a wildcard {{s3:ObjectRemoved:*}} to request notification anytime an object is deleted. For information about deleting versioned objects, see Deleting Object Versions.\r\n\r\nSQS can be used as a destination where events can be published:\r\n{quote}\r\nPublish event messages to an SQS queue—To set an SQS queue as the notification destination for one or more event types, you add the QueueConfiguration.\r\n{code}\r\n<NotificationConfiguration>\r\n  <QueueConfiguration>\r\n    <Id>optional-id-string</Id>\r\n    <Queue>sqs-queue-arn</Queue>\r\n    <Event>event-type</Event>\r\n    <Event>event-type</Event>\r\n     ...\r\n  </QueueConfiguration>\r\n   ...\r\n</NotificationConfiguration>\r\n{code}\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n*Possible Use Case*\r\n\r\nPoor Man's OSG Bucket Logging - every time an object is created/removed in a given bucket, a user could write a cronjob that checks the queue.  Each time there is a message, the cronjob script can write that information to another bucket.  In addition, since we support Versioning as well, this is something that could be leveraged with that
