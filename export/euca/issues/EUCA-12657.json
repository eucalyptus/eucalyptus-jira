Summary:\r\nWe believe there is no Eucalyptus bug here, but we need to understand clearly how instances with attached DAS or Overlay volumes behave during the RHEL upgrades of the SC and its host. Then we can refine our upgrade docs so that customers' instances are not terminated or become inaccessible, in DAS or Overlay modes.\r\n\r\nh3. Testing Status:\r\nDAS and Overlay testing to date has verified traditional upgrade (4.2 to 4.3 on RHEL6). OS el6-to-7 upgrade and re-installation of 4.3 on NC hosts has been verified. OS/4.3 upgrades of the set of non-NC hosts has shown some issues we've worked through, caused by testing process, system behavior, and Euca code issues.\r\n\r\nWe are now left with one issue to be tracked as a testing issue here. Upon completion, we may enter a DOC ticket to change our upgrade docs as needed.\r\n\r\nh3. Issue:\r\nWhen you upgrade the non-NC hosts as a unit, we've seen cases where instances running on NC hosts are terminated or become unresponsive to ping/ssh, during or shortly after the SC host's downtime when installing RHEL7, re-installing 4.3, and restoring cloud data. This is regardless of whether an NC has been upgraded to RHEL7/4.3 yet or not.\r\n\r\nh3. Theory:\r\n# EPH-NO-EBS: Ephemeral instances with no other attached EBS volumes survive the SC downtime. Detaching EBS volumes before upgrading the SC is OK.\r\n# EBS-ROOT-ONLY: EBS-backed instances with no other attached EBS volumes (besides the root volume) survive the SC downtime. The EBS root volumes go read-only until the SC comes back up.\r\n_(For either of the above, EBS volumes can be detached before the SC downtime, and the instance survives. When detaching EBS volumes, their filesystems should be unmounted, and apps should be stopped from using them as block storage, or you'll get I/O Errors trying to access them. These might put the instance at risk, like the ATTACHED-EBS case below, but instances shouldn't be trying to use a detached volume, so we're not testing that case.)_\r\n# ATTACHED-EBS: EBS-backed and ephemeral instances with attached EBS volumes (other than the EBS root volume) are at risk of termination or inaccessibility.\r\n# EBS-STOPPED: Stopped EBS-backed instances have no issue because they are not packed.\r\n\r\nh3. Experiment:\r\n# ATTACHED-EBS:\r\n## Is it after certain timeout?\r\n## Is it only when the SC comes back up?\r\n## Is it only when the SC comes up too early, without volumes available? \r\n## Sometimes instances are still listed as running by \"virsh list\", but are inaccessible to ping/ssh. Are they running? To find out, watch the instances during the non-NC upgrade:\r\n### Start a script on the instance that sends data out to other machines regularly, before upgrading the non-NC hosts.\r\n### Keep an ssh session logged in during the non-NC host upgrades. Run a script that shows the date periodically. If the ssh session is disconnected, we'll know the approximate time.\r\n\r\nh3. Example test case:\r\n# Run the create_resources bash script (originated by [~ccassler], forked and extended by [~lincoln.thomas]) to create various images, volumes, instances, etc.\r\n# Add another volume and attach to ebs-vols-stopped.\r\n# Create filesystems and files on some instances' ephemeral and EBS volumes.\r\n# Unmount and then detach 1 volume on each on the 3 \"-vols\" instances.\r\n# Detach another volume on ebs-vols-stopped.\r\n# Stop the \"-stopped\" instances\r\n# Puts these instances into these categories:\r\n## EPH-NO-EBS: paravirtual (i-d10d9010), inst-store-norm (i-020b81ef), inst-store-eip (i-2f1764d5)\r\n## EBS-ROOT-ONLY: ebs-eip-running (i-8d282532)\r\n## ATTACHED-EBS: ebs-vols-running (i-c3522c9d), inst-store-vols (i-87384e46)\r\n## EBS-STOPPED: ebs-stopped (i-3fcf03c9), ebs-vols-stopped (i-782daaed)\r\n# Log into each instance with ssh, stay logged in, run script to display \"date\" every 10 secs.\r\n# Start scp script using \"nohup\" (keep running even if this shell dies) to send a modified file to another host outside the cloud every 30 secs.\r\n# Upgrade the set of non-NC hosts per the existing upgrade docs.\r\n# See which instances are still up. If any are not, examine ssh outputs, scp'd files, and Euca/libvirt logs.\r\n# Re-attach one volume to \"ebs-vols-stopped\". \r\n# Restart the \"-stopped\" instances.\r\n# Re-attach the remaining detached volumes.\r\n# Examine any failures.\r\n# Based on these results, create DOC tickets and/or (unlikely) EUCA tickets.\r\n\r\nMuch of the above testing has already been done, but results have been inconclusive. This ticket captures the new rigorous testing to be done for this issue.\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Define behavior of DAS/Overlay instances with EBS volumes during OS upgrade","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12100":"0|i03wev:","customfield_10000":"1_*:*_1_*:*_484347318_*|*_3_*:*_1_*:*_630658784_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":"2016-08-18T16:01:55.483-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10004":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["lincoln.thomas(lincoln.thomas)","swathi(swathi)"],"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-12657/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/47400/comment/109210","id":"109210","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=swathi","name":"swathi","key":"swathi","accountId":"557058:ab7e71b5-781c-49ea-9f4d-ea9148c88f03","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Swathi Gangisetty","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"There is no necessity to differentiate among the different cases of disruption as all disruption is just the same - equally bad user experience. For instance a read-only file system on the guest due to loss of connectivity to backing EBS volume is just as bad as qemu terminating instance store instances with attached volumes that have lost connectivity. If the storage backend - be it SAN, Ceph or local filesystem on the Storage Controller as in the case of DAS and Overlay, is not available, all EBS usage in the guest will be disrupted. As per my understanding of current upgrade sequence, this would impact DAS/Overlay backed clouds. Since most of the production customers don't use DAS/Overlay I think its okay to have a slightly different upgrade procedure involving stopping EBS instances and detaching EBS volumes for instance store instances before upgrading Storage Controllers that provide DAS/Overlay storage.
