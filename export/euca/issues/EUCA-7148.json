I am going to close this ticket as 'Won't Fix' because for 4.0 the system behaves as designed (and does not violate AWS compatibility). Which is to say: bundles created by 'euca-bundle-instance' can be downloaded and unbundled using cloud private key (cloud-pk.pem) and not with the key of the user who owns the instance and the resulting bundle. The reason is because the bundle is created on the back end, which does not have access to the user's cert in the current design. (The cert is not part of the request on AWS because such bundles -- of Windows instances -- aren't intended to be unbundle-able.) \r\n\r\nI don't think it's a bad idea to allow such workflow in Eucalyptus, but that will require a little bit of design and some cross-cutting implementation work. Perhaps an image export service is a good way to tackle this, perhaps simply adding user's cert as Euca-specific parameter to bundle-instance is a good one. I'd love to have a discussion about this and hopefully complete the work in the next release. (We'll have plenty of image-related work to complete then anyway.)
