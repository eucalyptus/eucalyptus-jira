These appliances run an OS entirely from memory and thus\nwith such a feature they can build their entire OS into a ramdisk and run\ntheir kernel and initrd in the cloud. Once up, they can connect it to whatever\nservice they want for further testing.\n\nNote that this was possible with Eucalyptus 2, with Eucalyptus 3 this can no\nlonger be done (for whatever reason).
