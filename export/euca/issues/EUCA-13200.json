Problem\r\nBy design, an ELB cannot be directly connected to a private subnet using a public IP due to the nature of the private subnet not having an IGW and in our case using a NAT Gateway to get out to public addresses. When connecting a public-facing ELB (internet facing in AWS) to the public subnet (by design) which is routable to the private subnet, the backend ELB instance is unable to connect to the instance in the private subnet.\r\n\r\nh3. Cause\r\nThe current implementation of ELBs in Eucalyptus VPCs uses a default subnet in the loadbalancing account with an IGW which allows the service image to bootstrap itself. In our case this subnet is 192.168.48.0/20 and it is attached to eth0 on the service image. When the ELB is activated, an ENI is created on eth1 associated with the public subnet of the VPC for the target instance. This creates a problem for several reasons:\r\n* There are now 2 default gateways (eth0, eth1) pointing to two different subnets in two different VPCs\r\n* The private subnet in the target VPC is non-routable due to the default gateway of eth0 taking precedence\r\n\r\nThis cannot simply be fixed by removing the default gateway for eth0 for a number of reasons:\r\n* Primary interface (eth0) is required in order for the ELB to talk to the UFS node as well as NTP and DNS services to bootstrap the load-balancer-servo process\r\n* In some cases where only NAT is used in a public subnet there is no IGW present which would be required for backend instance boostrapping. This means the secondary interface (eth1) will be unable to reach external services for bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nh3. Workaround\r\nTo temporarily resolve this issue, a route needs to be added to the ELB backend instance for the private subnet in the target VPC. This is accomplished using the following methods\r\n1. Obtain ENI ID of the ELB backend instance by looking at {{nc.log}} running the backend instance and cross-referencing the eni with the rule chain in midonet to get the internal IP address of the ELB instance\r\n2. SSH into the ELB backend instance from an instance in your public VPC subnet\r\n3. Add the route to the private subnet for eth1\r\n{noformat}\r\nroute add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 gw 10.0.0.1 dev eth1\r\n{noformat}\r\n4. Verify ELB is now \"In Service\"\r\n\r\nh3. Suggested resolution\r\nRecommend having the ELB bootstrap process add the route to the ENI interface (eth1) when registering an instance that is on a private subnet. This will require the VPC is configured such that the public and private subnets properly route and could be added as a check when adding the route.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Public-facing
