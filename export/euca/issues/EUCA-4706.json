When the instance later gets started again it has to re-allocate a hardware address in the same manner that it would when running a new instance.  This isn't normally a problem because the hardware address is simply the address prefix followed by the instance ID, but in static mode the CC has to pull the address from a list.  Since the CC doesn't store any state about stopped instances it simply picks an address off the list, which may not be the same as the one the instance had the last time it ran.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-10T16:52:07.618-0600","updated":"2013-01-10T16:52:07.618-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/18463/comment/86233","id":"86233","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"STATIC mode has been deprecated in the latest release.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-08T18:44:17.256-0500","updated":"2015-05-08T18:44:17.256-0500"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
