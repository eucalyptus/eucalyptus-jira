This is because the CLC actuates the export and at that point in instance construction the destination NC is unknown to the CLC so it asks the SC to make the rootfs volume available to all NCs in the cluster.\r\n\r\nThis causes problems on some backends as well as makes for an inefficient process by which the SC must export the volume to a large number of hosts and later restrict that access to the NC that actually runs the instance.\r\n\r\nFor EMC particularly, if the cluster has N NCs it requires N operations to the SAN for the export where each operation can take ~2 sec and therefore this causes performance to decline linearly with the number of NCs in the destination cluster.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to have the NC act as a client of the SC directly and request access to the volume during instance construction the way the NC downloads the image manifest for instance-store images. To limit security exposure in the event of an NC being compromised the CLC should initiate a reference pre-authorization and receive a reference token from the SC which it includes in the instance-run request to the NC.\r\n\r\nThe NC should then request resolution of the reference token by the SC which will resolve the token exactly once and return the connection string that the NC should use to connect to the volume directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent flow for BfEBS:\r\n(create rootfs volume)\r\nCLC -> createVolume(snap_source) -> SC\r\nSC -> ok() -> CLC\r\n\r\n(exportAll rootfs volume)\r\nCLC -> attachVolume(all_ncs) -> SC\r\nSC -> ok(remote_device_string) -> CLC\r\n\r\n(run instance)\r\nCLC -> run_instance(remote_device_string) -> CC\r\nCC -> ok() -> CLC (async call)\r\nCC ->
