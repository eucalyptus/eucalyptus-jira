Currently, this NC hook (in tools/nc-hooks/libvirt-check.sh) faithfully implements the logic that used to be in check_libvirt_runtime(). \n\nGarrett pointed out that on some distros we may not want to perform this check-and-restart because this is best left to general mechanisms. Also, the mechanism for checking and restarting may vary among distros (e.g. '/etc/init.d/SERVICE status' vs 'service SERVICE status'), as well as the name of the service (libvirt-bin, libvirtd). Those are all valid points, but for now I wanted to have the minimal viable solution in place, since the current logic has been tested on the system that inspired this change in the first place.\n\n*Packaging implications:* While the installation footprint has not changed (tools/nc-hooks/libvirt-check.sh is not getting installed by the Makefile), packaging spec should install that hook (into $EUCALYPTUS/etc/eucalyptus/nc-hooks) on the distros where the fix is desired. Let's talk about where that is, but I suspect it will be at least Centos 5.x and 6.x.\n\n*QA implications:* Once we know what distros we are targeting with this hook and we have the packages that install the hook, the efficacy of the code change can be tested by shutting down libvirtd at will and ensuring that it is brought back. For distros on which we do not install the fix, we should provide instructions for how to configure the operating system to restart libvirtd automatically, and those instructions, then, are the ones to be QAed.
