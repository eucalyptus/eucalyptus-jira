Pls find below feedback on our LDAP implementation. \r\n\r\nOur LDAP might not have a standard setup and in our case we might be able to change the schema. The main problem with regards to the Eucalyptus LDAP configuration is that we will have a harder time to sell this to a customer if they also have an older LDAP schema.\r\n\r\nAs I see this, currently there are 2 issues:\r\n1) member vs. memberuid issue, it would be better to let the admin configure which base user DN to be used to select the group membership (or something similar).\r\n\r\n2) No anonymous read possible. Currently a user/password will need to be specified for the LDAP synch, but it would be good if this could be anonymously as well.\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-40","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Provide a flexible way to plug euca w/ LDAP","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=orenault","name":"orenault","key":"orenault","accountId":"557058:b4c2692b-cd19-4228-839c-3ef83c58683a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Olivier Renault","active":false,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=orenault","name":"orenault","key":"orenault","accountId":"557058:b4c2692b-cd19-4228-839c-3ef83c58683a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Olivier Renault","active":false,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_148280873885","customfield_12100":"0|i01l2v:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":["LDAP-PM"],"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["orenault(orenault)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":"RHEL 6 / Euca 3.1","customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-3654/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
