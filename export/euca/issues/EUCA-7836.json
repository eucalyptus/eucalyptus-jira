images. Before that, that collection may have been already cached in the proxy and possibly sent to the browser when ready. Depends on if the user logged in before the proxy cache was filled. Depending on network speed, it may take some time to get that list of images from proxy->browser, even with gzip on which takes the payload size down to about 4MB. (it used to be 36MB before some improvements, so this is much better than it used to be).\r\n\r\nAnother thing that \"might\" be going on is that we start getting excessive threads tending to the allimages cache. That shouldn't happen, so I'll throw in some debug and try a few AWS logins to see if that is behaving. that cache should only refresh every 20 minutes, so that really shouldn't load the proxy much, however we do that for each region, so that's 8x the data each 20 minutes.
