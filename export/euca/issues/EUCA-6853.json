This will mask both the specific backend used as well as the HA characteristics of that backend (active/passive for legacy Walrus vs active/active for new RiakCS handler).\r\n\r\nThis will introduce a new component type: ObjectStorageGateway. That must be registered independently of Walrus even if using the legacy Walrus implementation for storing data. ObjectStorageGateway will be Active/Active configurable with an arbitrary number of hosts providing this in a scale-out model.\r\n\r\nAll euca components that want to use S3 should lookup the ObjectStorage component type and will receive a reference to an Object Storage Gateway. The service url is: /services/objectstorage. The ObjectStorageGateway is in the data-path for all gets and puts, it does not hand off the request but routes all data including http chunks.\r\n\r\nRegistration should look like:\r\neuca_conf --register-osg -H <ip> -P object-storage -C <name>\r\n\r\nThe backend to use is configured by setting the following properties:\r\nobjectstoragegateway.s3url=[walrus|<some url>]\r\nobjectstoragegateway.s3accesskey=[walrus|<some access key>}\r\nobjectstoragegateway.s3secretkey=[walrus|<some secret key>}\r\n\r\nMany hosts can be registered as OSGs.\r\n\r\nTo use traditional Walrus, set each of the properties to 'walrus'. That will enable the component to automatically detect the enabled (and registered) walrus service in a possibly HA configuration and then route the request to that service.\r\n\r\nIf a URL is provided in s3url then an S3 request will be issued to the endpoint. That endpoint may be riakCS or some other S3-compliant service.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"EUCA-6603","customfield_11500":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach
