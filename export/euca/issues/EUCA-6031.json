I don't have the case number and I don't think it required the console to be active. This should be a resolved issue with 3.3.0..\n\n2- Monitoring is always enabled by default and will always query on regular basis to get informations and save it. This can be disabled if the customer isn't using it by setting the following 2 properties to '0': \"reporting.default_poll_interval_mins\" and \"reporting.default_write_interval_mins\".\n\n3- I also checked my 3.3.0 cloud for spikes when idle and my cloud seemed to be running just fine which seems to make me believe #1 is the issue here. But essentially, I added the \"-Dagentlib:hprof=cpu=samples\" statement in my \"CLOUD_OPT\" settings for my CLC and was able to use VisualVM to sample the CPU usage. Perhaps this can be used at the customer to sample their CPU spikes and we should be able to point to a thread that correlate to the spikes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=chuck","name":"chuck","key":"chuck","accountId":"557058:95e4b012-7cd1-4fd1-995d-eba573d35653","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Chuck","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-20T14:08:52.295-0500","updated":"2013-06-20T14:08:52.295-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/21089/comment/47981","id":"47981","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=chuck","name":"chuck","key":"chuck","accountId":"557058:95e4b012-7cd1-4fd1-995d-eba573d35653","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Chuck","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Just marked this case as relates to EUCA-5634 to keep track of the issue where this could be potentially be console related as mentioned in my previous comment.
