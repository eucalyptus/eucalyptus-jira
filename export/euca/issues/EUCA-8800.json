For that, I believe you would need:\r\n\r\n1. Proper SOA records for the zone (EUCA-7655).\r\n\r\n2. Support for zone transfers and way of limiting them (i.e. like the \"allow-transfers\" setting in BIND). I propose a new property \"system.dns.transfers\" or something similar.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be very nice to have a longer/configurable TTL for DNS records instead of the current 60 seconds. That would allow for more efficient caching and thus faster DNS operation.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Support for slave DNS servers","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=pablo","name":"pablo","key":"pablo","accountId":"557058:e2460987-e075-4fa1-b902-2d2397f65743","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Henrik Ahlgren","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=pablo","name":"pablo","key":"pablo","accountId":"557058:e2460987-e075-4fa1-b902-2d2397f65743","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2274ee918a27d45b051e5338b2da64e4?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Henrik Ahlgren","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_103873371988","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i02k8n:","customfield_10001":"2014-02-27T16:27:25.835-0600","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10000","value":"Customer Affecting","id":"10000"}],"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["pablo(pablo)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-8800/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
