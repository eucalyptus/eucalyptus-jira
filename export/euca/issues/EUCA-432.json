Although having the system report an IP if the VM actually has one and not\nreporting one if it doesn't makes sense, we don't actually have a way of doing\nthis; the hypervisors currently don't collaborate with a generic VM closely\nenough to actually know what the IP that has been assigned to a VM.  We try to\nget 'as close as possible' by choosing the address, inspecting the network at\nthe node through ipables, etc, but we never really know.\n\n  \n2.) DHCPd failures can be transient and so retry (there are currently two\nlevels) may actually bring up the DHCP server\n\n  \n3.) if the admin fixes whatever was causing the DHCPd failure, the instance\nshould work just fine after its dhcp client tries again\n\n  \n4.) ec2 semantics are undefined (I believe) for cases where virtual machines\nhave no IP addresses at all\n\n  \nTo improve upon this situation for the next release, here are my thoughts\nalong the lines of the original report here where the idea is 'the user should\nknow when the network hasn't been set up quite right'.  I think that in this\ncase the cloud admin needs to know right away.  With HA, there is now a system\nfor sending notifications to the administrator, and this type of transient\n'can fix in situ and things will come back just fine' type of problem are good\ncandidates for using this subsystem.  Also, current versions of DHCPd allow\nfor reconfiguration through an API so that we don't have to start/stop dhcp\ndaemons all the time, which will help the CC to determine better if a dhcpd is\ngoing to work or not at runtime.  With regard to letting the end-user know,\nwe'll have to discuss how to communicate this information back in an ec2\ncomptaible way, perhaps by setting 0's (this has caused lots of trouble in the\npast for 3rd party ec2 compatible systems) or some other mechanism.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \nOn Mon Mar 21 09:13:25 2011, vika.felmetsger wrote:\n\n> I forgot to specifies apparmor profile for Eucalyptus and, as a\n\n> result, CC was\n\n> failing to start dhcpd.
