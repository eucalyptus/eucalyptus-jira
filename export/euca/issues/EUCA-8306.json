I'd like to understand the value of going past the first ephemeral volume and, especially, going past four.\r\n\r\nSo, I get why Amazon does this. They probably have several tiers of physical hosts, each with a number of physical drives, they assign different VM types to different pools of machines, and then expose their spare physical drives (of which there could be up to four) as ephemeral. They could be combining the physical drives into one large volume, but don't, probably for performance reasons. And maybe implementation simplicity.\r\n\r\nNow, what do we have in Eucalyptus? CLC schedules instances, in part, based on total NC-local disk needs of the instance (i.e., CLC doesn't care into how many volumes the VM Type consists of, it just cares about the total disk space that the instance gets). Similarly, on the NC we only work with one storage pool for ephemeral volumes (this is the 'work' blobstore). If the machine has multiple physical drives, it is up to the admin to combine them into a larger volume, put a file system on it, and give it to Eucalyptus to use. (In the future, we could use the volume directly, a la DAS mode of the Storage Controller, but I still would argue that having Eucalyptus manage multiple physical disks or multiple file systems - as at least one old EUCA ticket wants - doesn't make sense.)\r\n\r\nOkay, so we have one storage pool on each node for use by instances and some portion of it allocated to each running instance. Can we chop up the instance's allocation into multiple volumes and offer them up as ephemeral0, ephemeral1, etc? Yes, we can. But it seems kind of silly. We're just artificially breaking up a continuous storage space for the sake of, what, looking just like AWS? I guess I can see how some people have gotten used to using ephemeral0 and ephemeral1 to separate different types of data in the way that people partition their hard drives. So, yeah, we can do the four ephemeral volumes for the sake of compatibility, but it seems really strange to go beyond four partitions.\r\n\r\nTo put it differently, why should we be in charge of managing partitions of VMs? Why would cloud users not want to manage that themselves? I'd love to hear the counter-arguments or use cases. I want to be clear that I am not resistant to adding this (the back-end can easily support it, most of the changes are actually on the front-end and GUI to let those various volumes be specified), I just don't understand the need.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-14T18:49:33.073-0600","updated":"2013-11-14T18:49:33.073-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/25434/comment/58496","id":"58496","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"So yes, I think there are performance factors here.  I wonder if AWS RAID's the local drives in their servers?  Perhaps they don't so they can maximise ephemeral space?  If they don't, then maybe each ephemeral volume is placed across spindles to balance performance?  So maybe performance is the key thing here and can be a justification for doing it a different way.  As a side note, we need to move away from using loopbacks on the filesystem, this is quite suboptimal.  \r\n\r\nI'm totally open to instead presenting all of the ephemeral space as a single block device to the instance and letting the user carve it up themselves.  At the moment we present it as a partition so a user cannot physically carve up the ephemeral space.  Any ephemeral space from the instance type is seen as that additional partition.  If we do give each instance a big block device, we'll need some best practice recommendations on how to optimise performance on the nodes.  Even if this is just \"we recommend RAID1+0 for the instance work space device\".   Maybe this is the quickest and easiest way of giving users flexibility?  Just give them a new whole block device as ephemeral space?\r\n\r\nThe problem; what happens for people moving a workload which makes use of ephemeral mappings in AWS to Eucalyptus?  How do we handle that?  Do we think users would want something which looks and behaves exactly like AWS?  I'm not fully convinced but for such a user it would mean image modifications and API call modifications.

inconvenient?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester
