Tsugawa","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"IP packet or Ethernet frame that go out to the port (or interface) it came in is always problematic (possibly generates ICMP redirect messages, they can be filtered, etc). In Eucalyptus, this happens frequently. In EDGE mode, due to private to public NAT'ing, packets destined to instances' own public IP go in to host's network stack (ebtables/iptables) from the instance's interface (vn_i-xxxx), and go out through the same interface (after address translations).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Linux bridge in CentOS7/RHEL7 includes support for what is called hairpin mode for ports. Bridge ports with this feature on allow frames to be sent to the port they came in, but, by default, hairpin mode is disabled. The same problem manifests in EUCA-12578 (but, in this case, CCs of MANAGED mode). This problem is difficult to debug/troubleshoot, since putting the bridge interface in promiscuous mode apparently solves the problem, so tcpdump make things work (since tcpdump puts interfaces in promiscuous mode).\r\n\r\nThe solution used in EUCA-12578, while not elegant (i.e., putting the bridge interface in promiscuous mode), works well, since public IPs are not assigned to the bridge in MANAGED mode. In the case of EDGE mode, public IPs are assigned to the bridge, and bridge interface in promiscuous mode can generate duplicate packets. So, the solution is to enable hairpin mode of instance interface ports on creation. This fix is implemented on NC code.\r\n\r\nconcise regression tests are passing. Tested that instances have access to its own public IP and other instances' public IPs (in single-node and two-node deployments).\r\n\r\nNote: depending on the physical network topology and NC_PROXY/NC_ROUTER configuration, there may be scenarios in which adjustments to bridge/bridge port configuration could be needed. It is difficult to anticipate what these scenarios would be, but it is important to keep in mind that there are differences in behavior between Linux bridges in CentOS/RHEL6 and CentOS/RHEL7.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tsugawa","name":"tsugawa","key":"tsugawa","accountId":"557058:619bab88-9b87-4778-995a-1e8a85d8b899","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c16b1da4b6426cad544b6eddd78d76b1?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c16b1da4b6426cad544b6eddd78d76b1?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c16b1da4b6426cad544b6eddd78d76b1?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c16b1da4b6426cad544b6eddd78d76b1?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"M Tsugawa","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2016-07-28T20:33:32.890-0500","updated":"2016-07-28T20:35:56.690-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/46406/comment/107532","id":"107532","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tony","name":"tony","key":"tony","accountId":"557058:353956db-b78c-4f3b-9096-f8f58e6709c8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tony Beckham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"The tests that caught this are passing but I have not verified myself manually.
