behaves differently depending on how the IP address was allocated and user privileges (user or admin):\r\n\r\n1. If the public IP address was allocated via euca-allocate-address, euca-associate-address associates the IP address to the specified VM. This is expected.\r\n\r\n2. If the public IP address was automatically associated during VM creation and an admin executes euca-associate-address to associate the IP to another VM, the IP address gets released (euca-describe-addresses return the IP address as “nobody  standard”, and DNAT rules are removed from NC) and no error message is returned. Both VMs loose public IP association.\r\n\r\n3. If the public IP address was automatically associated during VM creation and a user executes euca-associate-address to associate the IP to another VM, the error message “error (InternalFailure): Failed to find account” is returned. Both VMs were started by the same user. No change to the system – i.e., IP associations do not change.\r\n\r\nThis is likely related to how addresses are allocated: automatically associated IP addresses are owned by user/eucalyptus, while user allocated IP addresses are owned by the user. While admin can “touch” user/eucalyptus owned addresses, a user cannot.\r\n\r\nAWS documentation states that: [*EC2-Classic, VPC in an EC2-VPC-only account*|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#VPC_EIP_EC2_Differences]: _\"If the Elastic IP address is already associated with a different instance, it is disassociated from that instance and associated with the specified instance.”_\r\n\r\nAlso, [*in Elastic IP Addresses*|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#concepts-elastic-addressing]:_\"When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance, the instance's current public IP address is released to the EC2-Classic public IP address pool. If you disassociate an Elastic IP address from the instance, the instance is automatically assigned a new public IP address within a few minutes. In addition, stopping the instance also disassociates the Elastic IP address from it.\"_\r\nand, _\"When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance in a default VPC, or an instance in which you assigned a public IP to the eth0 network interface during launch, its current public IP address is released to the EC2-VPC public IP address pool. If you disassociate an Elastic IP address from the instance, the instance is automatically assigned a new public IP      address within a few minutes. However, if you have attached a second network interface to the instance, the instance is not automatically assigned a new public IP address; you'll have to  associate an Elastic IP address with it manually.
