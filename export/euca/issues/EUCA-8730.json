The approach was to set up a few NCs with many IPs each and then configure the CC to talk to them all (totalling 100 NCs) - you can't run instances this way, but the issue as reported should trigger just having that many NCs in the first place and waiting for an enable to happen properly.  What I did discover is that the bug where the CLC is not 'forgetting' about deregistered nodes may be causing a delay (since the CLC will continue to send enable messages for nodes even after they're deregistered), but I wasn't able to see any sigificant delay.  The node state model did look unusual, though, and I think it should be reviewed by CLC folks.
