They would like to be notified when usage reaches a particular threshold so that they can take action, such as increasing the quota or notifying the account administrator.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nAccount A has a quota for total volume size of 50GB.  Users in Account A are approaching this limit, with current usage of 41GB.  At 40GB, the cloud administrator would like have recieved a notification to tell them that they are 80% into their quota allowance for volume space.  This first notification would go to cloud administrator and perhaps Account A administrator too.  Later that week, volume usage passes 45GB, 95% of quota allowance.  At this point the cloud administrator would like to receive another request which is an imminent warning.  They can they initiative the business process to increase Account A's quota limit through the appropriate financial transaction (more monies plz), or to further warn Account A administrator that soon they will not be able to create more volumes.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nSoft Quota - notification mail to account admin and cloud admin\r\nHard Quota - priority notification mail to cloud admin and *maybe* account admin ","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-45","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Implement concept of soft and hard quotas with notifications for thresholds","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_155288160177","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i01g3z:","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":["Resource-Manager-PM"],"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["lwade(lwade)"],"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-2849/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
