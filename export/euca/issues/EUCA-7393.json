Going forward, we now have the capability to have sub-minor releases non-matching and the console rev-ing more quickly than Eucalyptus.  i.e. The console *could* have 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.4.4 coming out prior to 4.0, but Eucalyptus will only have 3.4.1 and 3.4.2.  The console would need to make sure there's a match between its 3.4.x version, and that Eucalyptus is on some 3.4.x version as well.\r\n\r\nCaveat, Eucalyptus and the UserConsole *will* sync at minor versions, i.e. 4.0 Eucalyptus will have a 4.0 User Console, same with 4.1.  There will be a forced synchronization point for those.\r\n\r\nRelated to this is https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-5037, which has the server response as to its version, which must also be
