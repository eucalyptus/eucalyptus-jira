In 3.0, we encountered a bug in the interaction between eucalyptus and the MySQL JDBC driver where pool connections were not freed (and reusable) in certain cases, which led to cases where eucalyptus could no longer access the DB.  In 3.1, after the switch to postgres (and related switch to the postgres JDBC driver), we have not observed this behavior, and thus the pool is functioning as expected.  We should no longer need to manually work around the previous pool issue by adjusting the pool size (which is now 512) for eucalyptus
