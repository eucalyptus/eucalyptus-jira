For example, an empty node with room on disk for 4 instances will be reported as *0 used, 4 available*. After an HVM EBS instance runs, which has no requirement on local node storage, the node would be reported as *1 used, 4 available* (assuming the capacity is disk bound and not CPU or RAM bound). This is an interesting suggestion with implications on CC's and CLC's resource accounting and scheduling, which promises better disk utilization in some cases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-06T22:48:11.018-0500","updated":"2013-05-06T22:49:32.412-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/18862/comment/61898","id":"61898","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=bcarpenter","name":"bcarpenter","key":"bcarpenter","accountId":"557058:0d642857-0240-4c71-9ecc-a005f189a5c9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Ben Carpenter","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Seems like this provides better use of the NCs' resources, especially in cases where there are many EBS emis without ephemeral disks, since they don't use NC disk resources.\r\n\r\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=bcarpenter","name":"bcarpenter","key":"bcarpenter","accountId":"557058:0d642857-0240-4c71-9ecc-a005f189a5c9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3b9ed713d6c1321ec281dfe517898920?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dbcarpenter%26avatarId%3D13701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Ben Carpenter","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-24T18:02:32.376-0600","updated":"2014-01-24T18:02:32.376-0600"}],"maxResults":6,"total":6,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
