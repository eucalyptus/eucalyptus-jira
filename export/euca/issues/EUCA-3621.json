However, with NetApp we require FlexClone and so this snapshot reserve option I think becomes meaningless? I presume that with Dell this is also the case, that we use some cloning mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn which case, what is this property good for and why is it included and defauled to 100%? The customer tried to create a 400GB EBS and we tried to reserve an additional 400GB on the SAN for the snapshot.
