Guide|http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html]:\n\n{quote}\nAn Amazon EC2 instance store consists of one or more instance store volumes. These volumes are usable only from a single Amazon EC2 instance during its lifetime; they can't be detached and then attached to another instance. Instance store volumes must be mounted before they can be used. By default, instances launched from an Amazon EBS-backed instance have no mounted instance store volumes. Instances launched from an instance store-backed AMI have a mounted instance store volume for the virtual machine's root device volume, and can have other mounted instances store volumes, depending on the instance type. For more information on instance store-backed AMIs and Amazon EBS-backed AMIs, see [AMI Basics|http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ComponentsAMIs.html].\n\nWhen you launch an instance, whether it's launched from an Amazon EBS-backed AMI or an instance store-backed AMI, you can attach instance store volumes to the instance using block device mapping.

However, EBS instances do not automatically get the ephemeral storage to which they are entitled unless you explicitly ask for it with one or more block device mappings.  Instance-store images do not behave this way.\n\nEucalyptus differs from EC2 in that it treats instances of every image type the same, allocating and attaching instance storage to instances regardless of the images' types.  So what we have here is a semantic difference, hence the \"AWS Compatibility\" component.\n\nRelated to this is Eucalyptus's subtracting the space taken by the boot filesystems of instance-store images from the amount of ephemeral storage that is presented to the instances.

difference.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett
