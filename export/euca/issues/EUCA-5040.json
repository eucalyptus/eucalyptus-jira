The reload method should look for entries that have the lodev name set and should re-export those volumes. The behavior should be to clear the lodev name and re-export the volume file and get the new loopdevice name (since the old value may not be valid anymore) and setup the iSCSI target appropriately.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this bug is that a non-clean reboot of the SC (i.e. when volumes are attached) can cause the state of the SC to become corrupted where it thinks volumes are

be.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Reload

You can do:\nreboot (clean or not)\ndetach-vols\nre-attach-vols\n\nAnd the system should be good to go with all attachements restored properly.\n\n[~shashi], the data will not be corrupted that is already on the disk, but the instance may leave the volume in an inconsistent state because some writes made it to disk and others didn't. This may leave an inconsistent state, but existing data will not be corrupted. This is possible even if this particular bug did not exist. The NC (client) will continue trying to write data, in particular the VM on the NC does not see a failure immediately on a reboot, it will still find data due to caching on the NC and in the instance. At some point if the connection is not restored and the caches are not flushed to the volume, then the VM will put the FS in a read-only mode. Reads will then start to fail as well.\n\nThe risk that this bug poses is that the volume will not be automatically reconnected after restart. I am testing this today to be sure that on a correct restart that the volumes are re-attached correctly. This will be a question of how iSCSI itself handles a disconnect and reconnect.\n\nI'll update with more info later today.\n\nFor an intended restart of the SC: there should be no volumes attached to any instance in that cluster. That ensures that volumes are consistent and instances will not see io errors.\n\nFor unintended restart (i.e. power failure): when the SC comes back up, detach each volume and re-attach it to the instance via (euca-detach-vol and euca-attach-vol). I need to determine if the admin can do this for all users or if each user would have to do this individually.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-02-15T12:33:10.059-0600","updated":"2013-02-15T12:33:10.059-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/19208/comment/39932","id":"39932","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Committed to maint/3.2/testing with commit id: aa8185b7e86065adcef09019204f2b073365e5fc\r\n\r\nDuring SC startup in OverlayManager it will scan the DB and attempt to re-export any volumes that were exported (had iscsi targets) on last shutdown. The decision is made based on the presence of a loopback device name in the DB. The reload process will restore loopbacks, assign new ones if the previous is taken by another resource, and ensure that LVM LVs are enabled and iSCSI targets reconstructed. If volume is already exported (i.e. just a service restart instead of a machine reboot), then the process cleanly leaves existing resources untouched.\r\n    \r\nAlso adds many INFO level log messages to track process during startup. Grep for 'SC Reload' in the cloud-output.log to see the process.\r\n\r\nTo TEST (easiest in a remote-SC config):\r\n1. Run instance\r\n2. Attach volume to instance.\r\n3. Check losetup -a and tgtadm --lld iscsi -m target -o show on SC. Should see a single loopback and target.\r\n4. Reboot SC\r\n5. Repeat #3 and ensure that output is the same.\r\n6. Do service eucalyptus-cloud restart to verify that after service restarts that output from #3 is unchanged.\r\n\r\nTo test loopback re-assignment:\r\n1. Same as above (steps 1-5), but before reboot, insert 'losetup -f <somefile>' in the /etc/init.d/eucalyptus-cloud script as the first executed line. This will cause the previous loop0 to be used and will force SC to remap loopbacks on reload.\r\n2. After reboot verify that iscsi target is fully functional and NC can read/write to volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-02-19T20:33:17.744-0600","updated":"2013-02-19T20:33:17.744-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/19208/comment/42267","id":"42267","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mclark","name":"mclark","key":"mclark","accountId":"557058:9b68e4d6-90d8-47d3-9c86-519770009164","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4227b07e7ea0ea725670fc4e987ed04d?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Wrote the following eutester script to test this in continuous automation.
