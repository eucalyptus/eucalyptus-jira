The thing is that you have to explicitly inform the CLC that an image happens to be a Windows image before it will recognize one as such.  For an instance-store image you do this by including \"windows\" in the bundle's name.  For an EBS image you need to do this by passing {{--kernel=windows}} to {{euca-register}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-08-23T19:34:40.202-0500","updated":"2012-08-23T19:34:40.202-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/15326/comment/31390","id":"31390","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=djben","name":"djben","key":"djben","accountId":"557058:95eb3228-402c-4961-b047-8f81e3194667","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fb25b1f5712a5f79ab86d9b1f5f6d899?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fb25b1f5712a5f79ab86d9b1f5f6d899?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fb25b1f5712a5f79ab86d9b1f5f6d899?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fb25b1f5712a5f79ab86d9b1f5f6d899?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Ben Lavalley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Thanks, Garrett -- I didn't add the --kernel switch, it wasn't mentioned in the user guide instructions for creating Windows EBS images. I guess that explains the discrepancy with platform being reported with euca-describe-images.\r\n\r\nI found some information about Hybridfox and how it was expecting the Platform field from an instance, which lead me to believe something wasn't working right with Eucalyptus.
