Froloff on 2010-03-15T11:45:07.128225+00:00\n\nHeh.  I have implemented \"QCOW2 volumes on a shared filesystem\" support too.  Please, take a look at my patch, it looks very familiar (but since we use shared filesystem, we don't need iSCSI/AoE to attach volumes to instances).\n\nMy work is based on LVM2Manager class.  Since we use shared filesysem, we don't need to \"export\" volumes, real file is attached to instance.  Snapshots created by copying image file, in future we may switch to GPFS snapshots.
