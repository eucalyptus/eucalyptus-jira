This happens after password expiry;  it can also happen in most companies if an employee is suspended but not fired (e.g. during a hacking investigation).  I think that in many companies it happens long term - the account continues to exist at least until all of the resources it owns have been reallocated and possibly even longer (so that it can be a creator of a resource belonging to someone else).  \n\nIn  this case\n* the LDAP data is not deleted\n* the user cannot log on to the web console (authentication fails)\n* the user's API keys remain valid\n\nThis becomes similar to a cached credential as in desktop Linux or Windows.  Some kind of similar handling is probably needed.    Right now I'm not sure what that should be though.
