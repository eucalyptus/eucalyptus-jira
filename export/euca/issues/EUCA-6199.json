not want! (use @grze, please)","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~graziano]:  It looks like there are three angles of attack here:\r\n# Managing service state explicitly.\r\n# Delays involved in fault detection.\r\n# Behaviour of the system during, and the length of time it takes, to do synchronization.\r\n\r\nWrt to #1 there will be more control over service state in 3.3 and I leave that aside as the failover remedy is the one approach available right now.\r\n\r\nThen, *#2* and *#3* are two different time intervals which contribute to the amount of time that the system is unable to service user requests:\r\n\r\nh4. #2 Failure Detection\r\nHere it would be worth understanding the extent to which this is causing the problem.  That is, there are surely failure modes where environmental and systemic factors determine how long it takes the system to tell when there is a failure.  The most likely culprit in the case of a hard failure (i.e., network communication is lost midstream) would be TCP KeepAlive probes and/or MSL.  That is, the system will block until a socket error pops, especially due to in-flight database transactions.\r\n\r\nh5. TCP KeepAlive\r\n{code}\r\n# Period w/ which keepalive probes are sent after failed acknowledgement.\r\n clc 18068 > cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl \r\n75\r\n# Number of probes to send before calling connection broken.\r\n clc 18069 > cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes \r\n9\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nA close under these parameters may take as long as ~11 minutes should the system be waiting on a keep alive connection.  We do use keep alive for service request sockets and may also do so for DB connections (I do not recall immediately).\r\n\r\nh5. TCP MSL\r\n{code}\r\n# 1/2 the max time socket will linger in TIME_WAIT\r\n clc 18067 > cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout\r\n60 \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nHere a half-open socket coinciding w/ a hard failure would result in ~2 minutes should the system be waiting on that socket.\r\n\r\nh4. #3 Database Recovery/Synchronization\r\nThere are a number of way in which our data synchronization could be improved to make the system behave better:\r\nh5. Incremental/Differential synchronization\r\nWe have an implementation of this developed during 3.0+ which never materialized as the go-to solution.  This would reduce the amount of data which requires synchronization to the delta between the coordinator state and the joining host.  This carries merge hazards (and likely fail stop or read/write repair conditions) and would need a bunch of testing from where it is now (read: not functional).\r\nh5. Read-only mode\r\nAlternatively, the system could accept read-only requests safely w/o changing the synchronization mechanism.  This may have some hidden catches (perhaps backend updates interfering or going wrong).  It would make it so that describe operations continue to work during sync -- this may be 99% of requests, in particular other tools/systems which poll for state.\r\n\r\nThese are coming from today's perspective.  A future split of user-facing services from internal ones will likely go a long way to simplifying and expanding the options that exist for managing persistent data.\r\n\r\nWe are able to induce these kinds of failures under contrived circumstances, but I would like to understand what we could do to gather more information about the kinds of failures experienced in the wild -- so we don't go off down the wrong path.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=decker","name":"decker","key":"decker","accountId":"557058:518b1ab0-12c2-4e72-b694-6c07036941a8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"do not want!

In the field IP stealing seems the way to decouple DNS from HA;\n* euca-describe-services may need to be a bit more friendlier to allow the understanding of the layout at a glance, or we need a euca-describe-ha that tells me more about the HA configuration in particular.\n\nI will let you dig into the technical aspects of the 3 parts you highlighted above. But I would say the following:\n\n*#2*: when we are explicitly testing HA, we do a graceful service eucalyptus-cloud stop. The machine stays up. I cannot think of a nicer way to test HA. In this condition we must failover in seconds at most;\n*#3*: the fact that the cloud is effectively non-operational during DB sync, amount for more downtime. So a test of HA (as mentioned above) plus a re-integration of the stopped CLC, could set one back 15 to 30 minutes. If you need to failover also the CC, now you need to ensure you do it in the proper order, otherwise the instances will be unaccessible for some time (that is the secondary CC won't tranisition into ENABLED until the CLC is ENABLED).\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=graziano","name":"graziano","key":"graziano","accountId":"557058:c440cc9e-8398-4f2e-8588-bdd59e3a7cf8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Graziano
