At the UDS, we decided that these ideas need not be fleshed out for Lucid (Eucalyptus 1.6.2), but they're certainly 'live' in that, at the core, the notion of building into the Ubuntu installation process a model for easily setting up node/VM network address allocation and management would be a powerful sub-system that Eucalyptus could depend upon when it comes to configuring the VM networks.  Right now, the Eucalyptus networking modes are highly configurable, but must largely be configured manually as no such sub-system (well defined model for dealing with large collections of dynamic networked machines) is readily available.  I believe that building such a system would allow the UEC, as the original report suggests, to present more sophisticated networking modes that are potentially simpler to manage.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucabot","name":"eucabot","key":"eucabot","accountId":"557058:007ef05d-c772-4437-b383-d2b42d2a88a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Eucalyptus Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"created":"2012-07-11T07:46:22.510-0500","updated":"2012-07-11T07:46:22.510-0500"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-2664/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
