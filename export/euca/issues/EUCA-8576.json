The important bit is that there are two message exchange patterns (request & response, streaming) which need to be sensibly handled by the timeout.\r\n\r\nCurrently:  Having both the {{ReadTimeoutHandler}} and the {{WriteTimeoutHandler}} would result in a timeout when either a read or a write hadn't happened for {{timeout}}.  \r\n\r\nInstead, what is needed is a timeout exception which is triggered when both a read and a write haven't happened for {{timeout}}.\r\n\r\nThis means a change like:\r\n*/com/eucalyptus/ws/Handlers.java:247*\r\n{code}\r\n  public static Map<String, ChannelHandler> channelMonitors( final TimeUnit unit, final int timeout ) {\r\n    return new HashMap<String, ChannelHandler>( 2 ) {\r\n      {\r\n        this.put( \"idlehandler\", new IdleStateHandler( Handlers.timer, 0, 0, timeout, unit ) );\r\n        this.put( \"idlecloser\", new IdleStateAwareChannelHandler() {\r\n\r\n          @Override\r\n          public void channelIdle( ChannelHandlerContext ctx, IdleStateEvent e ) {\r\n            if ( e.getState() == IdleState.ALL_IDLE ) {\r\n              e.getChannel().close();\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n\r\n        } );\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis leaves only the {{IdleStateHandler}} on both the server and client sockets.  The resulting behaviour will be to trigger when either:\r\n# A user or the system has not sent any data for {{timeout}}\r\n# The system has not received a remote response for {{timeout}}\r\n\r\n[1] http://docs.jboss.org/netty/3.2/api/org/jboss/netty/handler/timeout/ReadTimeoutHandler.html\r\n[2] http://docs.jboss.org/netty/3.2/api/org/jboss/netty/handler/timeout/IdleStateHandler.html\r\n[3] http://docs.jboss.org/netty/3.2/api/org/jboss/netty/handler/timeout/WriteTimeoutHandler.html","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Timeout handlers are not setup in a meaningful way","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=decker","name":"decker","key":"decker","accountId":"557058:518b1ab0-12c2-4e72-b694-6c07036941a8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"do not want!

That state gets cleaned up on the {{ChannelStateEvent}} corresponding to the {{CLOSE}} of the channel (called from {{/com/eucalyptus/ws/server/ServiceContextHandler.java:190}}).\r\n\r\nIs the {{e.getChannel().close()}} as called in the above snippet propagating that channel event up? (*it should!*)\r\n\r\nTo check this, there is a part I'm not sure how to do easily:\r\n# The client has to send a valid request (so that the server creates the context)\r\n# The request has to be a streaming upload request (so that the server doesn't close the socket after responding)\r\n# The client has to sit there sending nothing for longer than the {{timeout}}\r\nMaybe [~viglesias] knows? Possibly give a fifo file as input to {{s3tup}}?\r\n\r\nOnce there is a way to trigger this case, the question is whether there are extra {{Context}} objects piling up, which can be checked with:\r\n{code}\r\n ~ 19004 > euca-modify-property -p euca='com.eucalyptus.context.Contexts.channelContexts'\r\nPROPERTY\teuca\t{[id: 0x378ef0e7, /10.8.0.94:37702 => /10.111.1.45:8773]=com.eucalyptus.context.Context@4dae1943} was executed successfully.\r\n{code}\r\nThis example shows only the {{Context}} object for that request there.\r\n\r\nIf we do see that happening (*shouldn't*), the remedy is to explicitly clear the {{Context}} in the {{idletimeout}} handler like in {{/com/eucalyptus/ws/server/ServiceContextHandler.java:223}}\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=decker","name":"decker","key":"decker","accountId":"557058:518b1ab0-12c2-4e72-b694-6c07036941a8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"do not want!
