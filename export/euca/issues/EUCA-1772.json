With Windows, they only have a particular number of licenses across the cloud and so would like some way of being able to limit the number of Windows EMI's they can launch per accounts, to keep them under their license quota.  This would also apply to delegating license charges to groups within the organization; the cloud administrator could bill a group for 5 Windows licenses based on requirements and then apply a quota for these on the account.\r\n\r\nThis may have some other uses, which I haven't thought of yet.
