The database was pre-populated with data for 500 instances and 1000 alarms for two weeks in the future to allow just alarm evaluation.\r\n\r\nTwo cases were done.\r\n1) Each alarm has a single alarm action on the \"alarm\" state.  In this case 14,000 total alarms could be evaluated per minute.  (7000 on a similar setup.  There may be some hardware differences between machines).\r\n2) Each alarm has 5 alarm actions, on each of the \"alarm\", \"insufficient data\", or \"ok\" state.  Generally alarm actions would be executed every minute.  This only allowed 616 alarms to be evaluated per minute, with alarm action execution being the bottleneck.\r\n\r\nSo depending on which situation you subscribe to, either 14,000  * 1 = 14,000 (case 1) or 616 * 5 = 3080 alarm actions can exist in the system at any given time.\r\n\r\nThis is significantly smaller than the number forecast.  One thing to note is that alarm actions are evaluated at the clc.  Some parallelization may be possible by doing the evaluations at each UFS, but the a method of divvying up the alarms between the UFS hosts would need to be devised.
