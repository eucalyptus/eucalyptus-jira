We support more instance types to be more AWS-like, but we don't do anything with swap or root partition information. I agree that these are different than AWS, but think we simply need to document this better for 3.3. I'm assigning back to Tim because I think this is a Docs task in the short term. Chris might have a task further down the road to add more attributes to the instance type def.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-03-18T10:51:15.516-0500","updated":"2013-03-18T10:51:15.516-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/15957/comment/42114","id":"42114","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tjcramer","name":"tjcramer","key":"tjcramer","accountId":"557058:e076cf45-80ca-4b67-befb-7b0c21f32739","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tim Cramer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~decker], I don't think all the attributes are going to be included in this one.
