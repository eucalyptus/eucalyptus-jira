Let's see if we can agree on the use scenario here and then we can dig deeper on problem we need to solve.\n\nScenario-1: Users that use boot-from-EBS in a non-SAN environment are limited by the single choke point (SC / SC machine) as the SC is in the data path. Running multiple bfEBS instances in a single cluster very quickly hits a limit because of this single choke point. What can Eucalyptus do to alleviate this problem? \n\n(Would be great to know how many bfebs instances are recommended given an underlying network characteristic, SC storage configuration, etc. from the QA team AND separately from the CS team based on real usage at customer sites, or from the community at large if there are data points. But that's a different topic).  \n\nScenario-2: In a cloud where the SC is backed by SAN, there are no single choke points in the data path (nor single points of failure in HA mode), but multiple bfEBS instances see performance degradation (don't have numbers yet). Is there anything we can do to alleviate this problem? (May be the only solution is to ask customers to upgrade to 10G network on the storage side with bonded interface? but would like to foster that discussion)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=shashi","name":"shashi","key":"shashi","accountId":"557058:cc7ee5dc-1d4f-46c5-8068-6ae350275ba6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Shashi Mysore","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-08T16:56:53.026-0600","updated":"2013-01-08T16:56:53.026-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/18467/comment/41300","id":"41300","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ben.carpenter","name":"ben.carpenter","key":"ben.carpenter","accountId":"557058:6b4f07e8-d3db-46aa-9b22-94bda04278d8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c7394f2d2dbb1a55c58ce07d40102097?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dben.carpenter%26avatarId%3D12604%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c7394f2d2dbb1a55c58ce07d40102097?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dben.carpenter%26avatarId%3D12604%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c7394f2d2dbb1a55c58ce07d40102097?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dben.carpenter%26avatarId%3D12604%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c7394f2d2dbb1a55c58ce07d40102097?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dben.carpenter%26avatarId%3D12604%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Ben Carpenter","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This is essential for us as well.  We are using 25GB-50GB volumes for bfEBS instances, and we're attaching a 300GB-400GB volume containing a DB snapshot (mysql) to these instances. This adds up to almost 0.5TB per instance.  It works fine on AWS/EC2, but absolutely kills performance in Eucalyptus just to start up these large bfEBS instances (when multiple `dd` processes are running on the SC to set up the volumes, load average shoots up and the SC becomes unresponsive.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be good to see more architectural options for handling large-ebs and bfEBS-intensive use cases.  Eucalyptus seems to scale well on the CPU/RAM front, but is lacking in the disk/storage sector.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWe would love to be able to scale the storage horizontally (add more SCs), rather than be limited to trying to beef up our single SC with TBs of SSDs and 10/40/100 GbE NICs!!\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ben.carpenter","name":"ben.carpenter","key":"ben.carpenter","accountId":"557058:6b4f07e8-d3db-46aa-9b22-94bda04278d8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c7394f2d2dbb1a55c58ce07d40102097?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dben.carpenter%26avatarId%3D12604%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c7394f2d2dbb1a55c58ce07d40102097?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dben.carpenter%26avatarId%3D12604%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c7394f2d2dbb1a55c58ce07d40102097?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dben.carpenter%26avatarId%3D12604%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c7394f2d2dbb1a55c58ce07d40102097?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dben.carpenter%26avatarId%3D12604%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Ben Carpenter","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-07T18:10:34.100-0600","updated":"2013-03-07T18:10:48.819-0600"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
