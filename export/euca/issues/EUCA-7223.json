This occurred after a fresh 3.2.2 install. The main difference between the 2 clouds is the hardware between the 2 setup. One's an IBM setup which has the issue, the other an HP. On both setup, the CLC is running on a 32 cores i7.\r\n\r\nSymptoms: \r\ndescribe instance is slow to complete (5 minutes) and describe node does not work\r\n\r\nSign: \r\nWe noticed that Postgres is taking 50% of CPU even when the cloud is idle and there was 5000 DB locks acquired\r\n\r\nWhat was done: \r\nDisabling the sensors and restarting the cloud-controller reduced the CPU usage down to 25% and the number of locks was reduced down to 500. This resulted in describe-instances to respond within 1 minute. describe-nodes still does not complete.\r\n\r\nPlan moving forward:\r\nChris is currently looking at the database content.
