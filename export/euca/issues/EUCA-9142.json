The issue is that we do not have both an api and the implementation that tells the ebs instance to stop before it launches on NC. Calling stop-instance after run-instance does not work because run-instance performs a series of asynchronous actions, and calling stop-instance in the middle results in the undeterministic outcome. So probably EC2 has a way to mark an instance to stop after the instance's root volume is ready, and we need to have similar internal construct. \r\n\r\nSo I think we should not fix this in 4.0 and scope properly later (or wait a customer fiercely complains)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-17T19:10:37.990-0500","updated":"2014-04-17T19:10:37.990-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/29006/comment/72671","id":"72671","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~spark],\r\n\r\nI think if we can follow AWS compatibility on this, it would be more beneficial than waiting for a customer/user to complain.  The reason why this is important is for the use case where a user is importing an image that is made of multiple disks.  Some sysadmins will deploy VMware VMs/KVM VMs have multiple disks (e.g. /boot being on one device, / being on another device, /home residing on another device).  If a user wants to import a VM like this without having to rebuild the VM so it is all on one disk, [AWS recommends using ImportInstance for /boot, then use ImportVolume to import the other disks|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/VMImportPrerequisites.html].  After that, the user attaches them to the stopped imported instance, then starts the instance.  \r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nMake sure your VM only uses a single disk. Importing a VM with more than one disk is not supported. For Linux VMs, /boot and / can be located in different partitions, but they need to be on the same disk.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that you import the VM with only the boot volume, and import any additional disks using the ec2-import-volume command. After the ImportInstance task is complete, use the ec2-attach-volume command to associate the additional volumes with your instance.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThis use case would definitely help cloud admins migrate user VMs from a VMware infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nHope this helps.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-06-18T20:44:05.252-0500","updated":"2014-06-18T20:44:05.252-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/29006/comment/75898","id":"75898","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Documentation from libvirt.org that shows VM lifecycle.
