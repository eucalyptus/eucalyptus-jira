So, only if they're using DAS or Overlay as their block storage (EBS), they need to ensure that tgtd is running whenever the rest of the Euca cloud is running. The simplest way to ensure this is to add it to chkconfig to start at boot time, e.g.:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n# chkconfig --list tgtd\r\ntgtd            0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis is a good chkconfig output signifying it will start at boot. If they were all \"off\", then it should be changed to start at boot by:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n# chkconfig tgtd on\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe above \"--list\" command should then show the \"on\"s.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, they can start and stop the service at will:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n# service tgtd

future, thus Resolving this issue. The only verification would be to verify that doc issue.\r\n\r\nAnother reason Eucalyptus should not manage tgtd: It could be used for block storage needs outside the scope of Eucalyptus, therefore we may not be the only user of tgtd. So we should not try to own or manage that service. We could consider making sure it's running when we start the SC, but being a standard Linux service it seems commonplace to leave that duty to the sys admins.\r\n\r\nIf we do choose to change this, we should probably open a new ticket to implement that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-07-12T13:59:52.774-0500","updated":"2016-07-12T13:59:52.774-0500"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-12175/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
