We can come up with a script that traverses the account and deletes resources in the right order, or something along those lines. Should discuss with QA to see if anyone's done this before. \r\n\r\nWhat about preventing accounts from being deleted if they still own resources? [~gholms] says we should be doing this, but we probably aren't. Not sure what the level of work is to get the server to look for that. Then can we list what the resources are and allow the user to issue a command to delete them all?\r\n\r\nDeleting one account's resource can lead to fallout in other accounts. If I own a public image and I delete my account, you can't use that public image anymore. \r\n\r\nWhat about owner-id filter on all commands? Not all services have filters. If you are the cloud admin, should be able to create access keys that that account and use those to find everything in that account. Use account admin's keys or create keys as account admin. Could create script, if you give keys for account admin, it will list and delete all resources. We should document the commands it uses to list things, [~gholms] says this could be at least 15 commands. Two commands needed: one to list everything, and one to list and delete. \r\n\r\nWould need to indicate what order to delete things in, so that GUI can do this too. From the GUI side, need to inform users that all resources associated with the account will also be deleted, and then delete them in the order recommended by [~gholms]. Need an associated GUI ticket. If we come up with a script that uses boto, would be really easy to port. \r\n\r\nDoesn't need to be tied to a release, can just go into a repository of useful scripts. [~gholms] can't work on this before 4.2 comes out, but after, or maybe someone else can write it.
