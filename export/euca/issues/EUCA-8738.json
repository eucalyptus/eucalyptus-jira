The following is a list of steps to reproduce this issue:\r\na) Identify an EMI to de-register. For example we select EMI ID emi-05C2396B , now execute the steps shown below as cloud administrator \r\n\r\nb) Execute the first euca-deregister command on the EMI ID\r\n\r\n{code}\r\neuca-deregister emi-05C2396B\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nc) Note the state of the EMI\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n euca-describe-images | grep emi-05C2396B \r\nIMAGE emi-05C2396B \r\nccsweb_64bit_ps_lfs_rel_20m2_09_67-ci1/dummy.img.manifest.xml 735643887253 \r\nderegistered private i386 machine eki-2ADF38A9 eri-16693869 instance-store \r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIt is shown as de-registered.\r\n\r\n(d) So now de-register it again as per official documentation for 3.3.2 here https://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/eucalyptus/3.3/admin-guide/image_remove.html\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n euca-deregister emi-05C2396B \r\neuca-deregister: error (DeregisterImageType): To deregister emi-05C2396B \r\nall associated instances must be in the terminated state. \r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(e) Confirmed using \"euca-describe-instances verbose\" (ran as cloud administrator) that there are no instances running using emi-05C2396B.\r\n\r\nAlso confirmed no instances are running on the NC that use the EMI emi-05C2396B (does not matter I think)\r\n\r\n(f) Login to the CLC as root user and execute this command:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n# psql -h /var/lib/eucalyptus/db/data -p 8777 eucalyptus_cloud\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n(g) Once in the psql prompt , run the following SQL query to find out the ID of the emi in question\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nselect * from metadata_images where metadata_display_name='emi-05C2396B';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNow note down the ID and use it against the metadata_instances table like this\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nselect * from metadata_instances where machineimage_id='8a1f98a8426b796b01426f628e0512f4';\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote down the instance IDs reported by the last SQL.

Again check the de-register step, it fails with same error\r\n\r\n(i) Stop the CLC service, pause and check no CLC or postgres processes are running, start the CLC service. Re-check as mentioned in (h), euca-deregister still fails with same error and records are still there in metadata_instances table.\r\n\r\n(j) Note the instances creation and last update timestamp is
