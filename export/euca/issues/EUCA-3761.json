What you propose in the description of this ticket is that instead of taking a snapshot of an image in cache, we make a copy of the image in cache to the work directory, correct? That's actually how early versions of caching used to work and that behavior is still possible -- though untested and undocumented -- in 3.4 using DISABLE_CACHE_SNAPSHOTS=\"1\" flag in eucalyptus.conf on the NC. (I just tried it in 4.0 and there is something new we're doing that breaks that behavior. Though I could dig in a bit more and it is likely not hard to fix that.)\r\n\r\nNow, as for a DAS solution, I support that. And blobstore is designed to work with it.
