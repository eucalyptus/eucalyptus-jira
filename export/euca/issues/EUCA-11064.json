In AWS this is accomplished using a set of well-known account IDs/CanonicalIDs. That solution does not work for Euca since they are generated at initialization.\r\n\r\nFor S3 ACLs, the possible identifiers are: CanonicalID (generated uuid), Account ID (a non-aws compatible but legacy supporting capability unique to Euca), Group URI, and Email address.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n1.Use invalid, but unique internal and well-known email addresses for service accounts. For example, loadbalancing@{euca-service}, ec2@{euca-service}, etc.\r\n\r\n2. A group URI that refers to a specific service only. e.g. http://euca/services/loadbalancing. This is a semantic departure because we are referencing a single identity rather than an actual group, but as a mechanism it could work and be well known.\r\n\r\n3.

It looks like [~jloza] replied almost at the same time...\r\n\r\nThat suggestion: use IAM account aliases.This means we have to add support in the ACLs for them (for system accounts only) and eventually for supporting them in IAM policies/bucket policies as well. As such, [~sjones], I'd like your thoughts. Aliases are not supported in AWS IAM policies, so we'd be deviating there, but because we use aliases that are 'invalid' from an IAM perspective (they don't conform to the regex) for system accounts we can be assured that they cannot be ambiguous or changed to point to other accounts by users. There could be sources of ambiguity once accounts are multi-region, unless we unify the system accounts as well so there is only one account for all regions.\r\n\r\nThey look like: \"(eucalyptus)loadbalancing\", \"(eucalyptus)compute\", etc.\r\n\r\nSo in place of a CanonicalId in the S3 ACL the user can specify in the same XML element: <CanonicalUser>(eucalyptus)loadbalancing</CanonicalUser>. It would be resolved by the service to exactly one canonicalID just as S3 and OSG does with email addresses. The ACL stored by the service would refer to the canonicalID, not the alias.\r\n\r\nAnother option that seems possible, but has upgrade implications, is constant and well-known accountIDs for system accounts created at cloud install time (e.g 000001 is euca, 00002 is ec2, 00003 is loadbalancing, etc). We have a hardcoded number for the system account anyway (1) so we have to handle the conflict problem with the auto-generated account numbers.\r\n\r\n[~sjones], [~decker],

This leads to an inclination towards co-locating it in the DescribeServices operation which already serves that purpose (and so would presumably have access to the needed information).\r\n* The converse view also holds water:  The information is about an account and should come from ListAccounts.  This isn't exactly a counter-point since the IAM service would need to be able to identify the correct cases where the information should be presented to the user (i.e., it would be a special case).\r\n* Adding the information to DescribeServices doesn't have any intrinsic complications with authorization -- the purpose of the operation is to report on service attributes.  In IAM, though, the ListAccounts operation (which does report sensitive information) would need to take into account a special case here (and open up new issues should there be any flaws).\r\n\r\nLastly, intuition says that the discovery of this information has motivations due to other circumstances, too.  Stipulating for the moment that it is a generic circumstance (i.e., not just for granting access to resources even) then the information has to do more with services (and should be in DescribeServices) rather than being a special case about an IAM account (that the services reports about under very specific circumstances in ListAccount).\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=decker","name":"decker","key":"decker","accountId":"557058:518b1ab0-12c2-4e72-b694-6c07036941a8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"do not want!

The result is a 403. I've confirmed that euca admin and account admins can perform the operation just fine, but regular users cannot.\r\n\r\nMy question is: is it reasonable to grant regular users access to the operation, and if so, should we filter on only API services? I'm happy to implement whatever is needed.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I think the best solution is some sort of 'describeComponents' or analog that would describe only the logical components and not each specific service instance (e.g. compute, objectstorage, identity, etc as single entries only with a DNS name for the service). But, I don't think that is reasonable in the 4.2.0 timeframe. I think only exposing user-API services is sufficient for now without revealing too much sensitive info (the set of hosts, service state)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach
