in my case.\r\n\r\nThe initial memory usage of the UI, when logged, on was 7.2 MB. Upon the first viewing of the all AWS images on the region Oregon jumped the memory to be 65.8 MB. When switched over to N.California, it was at 107 MB, then going back to Oregon's image page caused the memory to go up to 155 MB. Repeating back and forth between Oregon and California, the memory size continuously goes up to 210 MB, 257 MB, etc.\r\n\r\nPlus, another thing to notice is the number of the objects held by the browser, which was reached to 1.3 million objects with 1.0 million items in arrays. It is known that Firefox is not good at handling such a large size of arrays and strings.\r\n\r\nIn order to see the memory usage of the UI:\r\n\r\n1. Open the UI on Chrome and log into AWS.\r\n2. Open the Developer's tools on Chrome.\r\n3. Select the profiles view on the Developer's tools\r\n4. Perform the initial \"Take Heap Snapshot\" action to measure the initial memory usage.\r\n5. Go to the image landing page and check out the all AWS images by clicking off the filter.\r\n6. After the images are loaded, go to N.California region and check out the all AWS images in that region\r\n7. Repeat the step 5 and 6 a few times.\r\n8.

So, in order to verify if the memory leak condition also exists while pointing to Eucalyptus, we would need to set up a test cloud with a considerably large set of images and repeat the steps above.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kyolee","name":"kyolee","key":"kyolee","accountId":"557058:b64cc631-43b8-4df2-bdce-93d4da9b2097","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kyo Lee","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-08T21:19:33.248-0600","updated":"2013-11-08T21:19:33.248-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/24756/comment/58049","id":"58049","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kyolee","name":"kyolee","key":"kyolee","accountId":"557058:b64cc631-43b8-4df2-bdce-93d4da9b2097","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kyo Lee","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"After loading Eucalyptus with 40+ images, repeat the steps above, and also discovered the same memory leak issue when navigating the image landing page.\r\n\r\nWhenever the image landing page was displayed on the browser, with 43 images, the browser's memory usage would add up between 3 to 8 MB per visit.

As result, per each region, the browser ends up accumulating 60 MB worth of image data. This mean that if a user visits a different region, the browser is loaded with 120+ MB of image data so that the browser is bounded to slow down substantially or even crash.\r\n\r\nThe attempted solution for this release was to clear up the cache of the previously visited region. However, it turned that due to the complex in our current UI, this approach was not trivial at all; during this investigation, it was learned that our UI leaked memory at a significant rate throughout every operation. So, attacking this issue itself would demand a whole release cycle to refractor and QA to ensure that no regressions would result from it.\r\n\r\nAnd, regardless of this memory leak issue, it was also confirmed that loading the entire AWS image set on the browser was not a viable approach for the client-side application. The average size of the AWS image set per region is about 60 MB, which is enough to impact the user experience on the browser once it is loaded.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is one quick way to solve the issues above for this release, that is to trigger refresh of the browser when the user selects a different region, which can be done by adding a single line:\r\n\r\nlocation.reload();\r\n\r\nBy doing so, the memory that was occupied the huge AWS image set and other resources will be freed as the user switches over to a different region. \r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kyolee","name":"kyolee","key":"kyolee","accountId":"557058:b64cc631-43b8-4df2-bdce-93d4da9b2097","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kyo Lee","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-19T20:30:32.777-0600","updated":"2013-11-19T20:30:32.777-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/24756/comment/58506","id":"58506","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kyolee","name":"kyolee","key":"kyolee","accountId":"557058:b64cc631-43b8-4df2-bdce-93d4da9b2097","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kyo Lee","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"\r\nFor the temporal solution for the release of 3.4.1, the pull request has been created:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-console/pull/240\r\n\r\n, which includes one line fix to trigger reload of the browser.\r\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kyolee","name":"kyolee","key":"kyolee","accountId":"557058:b64cc631-43b8-4df2-bdce-93d4da9b2097","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2e79a9bccb40460b7300d8cdaa567c8a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkyolee%26avatarId%3D11105%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kyo Lee","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-20T12:01:28.706-0600","updated":"2013-11-20T12:01:28.706-0600"}],"maxResults":14,"total":14,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
