Our RPM builds do, and there's code to make Fedora and Precise do so as well.  I'm not sure why RHEL and CentOS would be different.  (Actually, I can think of _one_ reason, which is that people don't know how debuginfo packages work, and wanted to be able to use gdb to troubleshoot a build.  If this is the reason, it's not a good one.)\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons for changing this.  Among them:\r\n\r\n* rebuilding axis2c from source in every QA run is a waste of time\r\n* this makes the configuration of paths different between source builds and RPM builds in a way that's just unnecessary\r\n* there's no way for me to be sure that the tarballs used in the source build are the same as what's in the package\r\n* I might want to build against a bugfix version of axis2c at some point, and I should be able to do this by simply configuring another yum
