He gathers all the required information and is prepared for the upgrade. He finally follows the upgrade documentation and performs the upgrade.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise after the upgrade some of his instances fails to show a keypair associated to them. These instances were running before the upgrade. This seems unusual to him because those keypairs are still visible to the cloud administrator via DescribeKeyPairs.\r\n\r\nLooking out for more information on exactly what went wrong in the upgrade process he starts looking at the logs.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise most of the logs related to the upgrade process are basically of no help to him. In specific are:\r\n\r\na) upgrade.log - This file is basically logging a very simple information that is not consumable by cloud administrator as he cannot make anything out of it except the fact that the upgrade was a success\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n#                           UPGRADE INFORMATION\r\n#================================================================================\r\n# Old Version:              3.4.2\r\n# New Version:              3.4.3\r\n# Upgrade keys:             false              using:\r\n# Upgrade configuration:    false              using:\r\n# Upgrade database:         true               using: upgrade_db\r\n# Same version:             false              using:\r\n# Start upgrading: db\r\n//usr/sbin/eucalyptus-cloud -u eucalyptus -h / --upgrade  --upgrade-old-version=3.4.2 --upgrade-old-dir=/var/lib/eucalyptus/upgrade/eucalyptus.backup.1406222890\r\nUpgrading your database...\r\nulimit: resource=7 soft=65536 hard=65536\r\nulimit: resource=6 soft=385877 hard=385877\r\nulimit: resource=6 soft=-1 hard=-1\r\nulimit: resource=7 soft=65536 hard=65536\r\nulimit: resource=6 soft=385877 hard=385877\r\nulimit: resource=6 soft=-1 hard=-1\r\nulimit: resource=7 soft=65536 hard=65536\r\nulimit: resource=6 soft=385877 hard=385877\r\nulimit: resource=6 soft=-1 hard=-1\r\n# Done upgrading:  db\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nCouple of immediate improvements to be included in upgrade.log are to have timestamps on when the upgrade was started and when it got completed. The timestamps are logged in the {{database_events}} database under database_upgrade_log this information is useful for the cloud administrator and should be provided in the upgrade.log\r\n\r\nCurrently it shows\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n--\r\n-- Data for Name: database_upgrade_log; Type: TABLE DATA; Schema: public; Owner: eucalyptus\r\n--\r\n\r\nCOPY database_upgrade_log (id, \"timestamp\", upgrade_from_version, upgrade_to_version, upgrade_state) FROM stdin;\r\n55603272-306a-41ef-a4cf-043ef165a2c0    2014-07-24 21:55:09.204 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  BEGIN_UPGRADE\r\n06ce1a69-d97f-40ff-a4a8-e558365f6fb6    2014-07-24 21:55:09.23  v3_4_2  v3_4_3  PRE_BACKINGUP_DATABASE\r\n90a33724-99c7-49ea-9455-3f41d53af961    2014-07-24 21:55:34.146 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  PRE_COPYING_DATABASES\r\n010b92b9-2bf1-4f23-bf4f-1f39131c77e6    2014-07-24 21:55:42.795 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  PRE_SCHEMA_UPDATE\r\ne09d8ec4-4553-415a-96a8-40c813c8dab7    2014-07-24 21:55:51.597 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  PRE_SETUP_JPA\r\nb14d3b41-5275-4803-9af1-110389527c98    2014-07-24 21:55:51.624 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  RUN_PRE_UPGRADE\r\n8df219d5-452e-46f8-bba6-e4955d25cf34    2014-07-24 21:55:51.78  v3_4_2  v3_4_3  RUN_ENTITY_UPGRADE\r\ndbfefbab-f2f7-436d-99fa-afe73513c554    2014-07-24 21:55:51.808 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  RUN_POST_UPGRADE\r\nbed34ff8-b20f-4c4f-a253-526059c0be25    2014-07-24 21:55:51.839 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  POST_SHUTDOWN_JPA\r\nc1ffbd0d-875e-40e8-ace3-c0141bcfbc77    2014-07-24 21:55:54.132 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  POST_DELETE_ORIG_DB\r\nadd831f4-4a70-4ed1-a48d-b5fb63e37445    2014-07-24 21:55:54.578 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  POST_RENAME_NEW_TO_ORIG_DB\r\n78dea3a2-1bbe-4171-a397-8b85414ba39e    2014-07-24 21:55:56.507 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  POST_DELETE_OLD_DB\r\n7d2a7a1a-4f1d-4cb1-9049-07f9f04073ac    2014-07-24 21:55:56.531 v3_4_2  v3_4_3  COMPLETED\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nOn top of the timestamps we need to also make sure the log messages pertaining to upgrade are not getting logged into cloud-output.log only. If they can be logged into upgrade.log that would be considered as a huge improvement because then the cloud administrator has 1 single file to look at for logs from the upgrade process. Most of the time the logs in cloud-output.log will get rotated and if the administrator has spend considerable time in identifying system weirdness he looses that window of time to get the right logs.\r\n\r\nb) startup.log - This log file logs all the messages generated by the system when it get started or stopped or something unusual happens like a cloud administrator performs a {{kill -3}} to collect thread dumps. Except thread dumps at-least all other messages getting logged into this file needs to have timestamp otherwise there is no meaning in reading the log file.\r\n\r\nSome of the messages logged in the file are\r\n\r\n{code}\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space\r\nDumping heap to //var/log/eucalyptus/java_pid30137.hprof ...\r\nHeap dump file created [353355026 bytes in 3.020

startup.log has no information about timestamps which could be useful to correlate certain important events with system start-stop-kill-3 etc.\r\n\r\nIn general speaking there could be a problem specific to the use case which needs to be looked at separately but this improvement tries to capture what the product can do to improve the debugging of the system after a weird result is shown after the upgrade is successfully complete.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or
