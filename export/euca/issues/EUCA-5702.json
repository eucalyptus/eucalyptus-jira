specifics, but generally they have the customer setup reporting with AWS. I believe the report files are generated by AWS on a user configurable cycle (don't quote me on that). The report is pushed to an S3 bucket that's dedicated to storing reports. The user gives the cost reporting tool access to the bucket. The tool parses the file into the vendor's DB and then thu apply the magic.\n---- \nTag values are included in the reports. So, for example, the entry for a given instance will include size, start time, end time (if applicable)...etc. and the tags applied to that resource. \n----\nAdditional reference:\n\nThe section on this page that discusses Cost Allocation and Tagginghttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/about/getbill.html#allocation\n\n\"Tags represent your business dimensions and are used in your cost allocation report\"  Source: http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/08/21/aws-billing-enables-cost-allocation-reports/\n\nAttached you will also find an example of the AWS billing report. Unfortunately I don't have one that includes tag values, but I hope this will help product planning / development.\n----------------------------------","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucacolby","name":"eucacolby","key":"eucacolby","accountId":"557058:2399a28c-111f-487f-a7c3-c97d4afe7520","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Colby Dyess","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-04-12T09:26:31.693-0500","updated":"2013-04-12T09:26:31.693-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/20451/comment/43199","id":"43199","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucacolby","name":"eucacolby","key":"eucacolby","accountId":"557058:2399a28c-111f-487f-a7c3-c97d4afe7520","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Colby Dyess","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"AWS billing report.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucacolby","name":"eucacolby","key":"eucacolby","accountId":"557058:2399a28c-111f-487f-a7c3-c97d4afe7520","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Colby Dyess","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-04-12T09:29:06.492-0500","updated":"2013-04-12T09:29:06.492-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
