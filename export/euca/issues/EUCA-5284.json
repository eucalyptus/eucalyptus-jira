The algorithm it uses to determine what fraction of available disk space to allocate to each is not exposed.  Thus, the admin does not know how large disk images can be to allow for VMtypes to tesselate properly.\r\n\r\nFor example.  The current algorithm appears to allocate 33% (roughly) of available disk space to instance work space and 66% to instance cache space.  Say that the available disk is 100GB and there are 8 cores in the system.  If the admin sets the m1.small (with 1 core) disk size to 10GB, the NC will (correctly) determine that it can only run 3 m1.smalls size there is only 33GB available for instance work space.\r\n\r\nThe effect is hard to debug as well.  running describe-availability-zones verbose will show 3 m1.smalls and, if the same 10GB size is set for the next size up (2 cores), 3 of those, and for the 4-core version -- finally correctly -- it will report 2.\r\n\r\nThus the system works properly and makes sane decisions but the admin cannot determine (at least not without reading the NC logs and understanding the rather eloquent messages now logged there) how much space is being considered available for the NC and, similarly, how the NC plans to apportion that space between cache and instance work space.\r\n\r\nThe feature I'm requesting is on in which the space constraints used by the NC are both advertised and, ideally, controllable from the admin console.  Extra points if this feature is tied to the VMtype definition interface (e.g. showing how much of the apportionment if the work space will be consumed by a specific disk size associated with a VMtype definition).\r\n\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-42","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"would like a way to size VMtypes based on NC resources from admin console","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=rich","name":"rich","key":"rich","accountId":"557058:8c482bdc-e25e-4adf-8ce3-d545bda65679","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/836ed5700fb9db2dd603525a729cf69f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/836ed5700fb9db2dd603525a729cf69f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/836ed5700fb9db2dd603525a729cf69f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/836ed5700fb9db2dd603525a729cf69f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Rich Wolski","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=rich","name":"rich","key":"rich","accountId":"557058:8c482bdc-e25e-4adf-8ce3-d545bda65679","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/836ed5700fb9db2dd603525a729cf69f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/836ed5700fb9db2dd603525a729cf69f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/836ed5700fb9db2dd603525a729cf69f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/836ed5700fb9db2dd603525a729cf69f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Rich Wolski","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_135278317663","customfield_12100":"0|i01vwf:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":["Maintainability-PM"],"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["rich(rich)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-5284/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
