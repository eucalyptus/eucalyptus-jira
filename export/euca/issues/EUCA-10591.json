As X.509 credentials are limited in supply and unnecessary until relatively late in the setup process, initial admin tool configuration should not be convolved with creation of X.509 credentials.  To fix this we need to replace part of {{euca-get-credentials}} with a client-side equivalent that obtains a list of endpoints for each AWS service and admin service, obtains credentials via direct database access as before, and outputs it in a form that the admin tools can use.\r\n\r\nThe server-side mechanism that solves EUCA-10590 could easily work for this as well, as apart from the additional need for admin service URLs, the requirements are the same.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done this command can later be replaced with one that additionally calls {{AssumeRole}} for the {{InfrastructureAdministrator}} role and returns the credentials for that role instead.
