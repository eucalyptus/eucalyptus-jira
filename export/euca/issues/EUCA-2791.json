If a node controller goes unavailable, when you try to launch new instances in that cluster, the public and private ip will always be 0.0.0.0.  I've simulated this by pulling the network on a node controller and waiting for the frontend node to deem the affected instances termed and clear it from the list of available instances.  This is a huge issue because the only way to correct the issue is the cleanstop/cleanstart the CC.  This means that if you have other node controllers in this cluster with running instances, the ip aliases and iptables rules will be cleared.  I've played with CCclient_full and was able to restore the network state of the instances / nodes that were previously running, but you shouldn't have to do this everytime you lose a node.\n\nArwin","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Unable to launch new instances in a cluster after a node controller crashes","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucabot","name":"eucabot","key":"eucabot","accountId":"557058:007ef05d-c772-4437-b383-d2b42d2a88a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Eucalyptus Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucabot","name":"eucabot","key":"eucabot","accountId":"557058:007ef05d-c772-4437-b383-d2b42d2a88a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Eucalyptus Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"10000_*:*_1_*:*_1322058389_*|*_6_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12100":"0|i01ftj:","customfield_10001":"2012-07-26T15:52:24.563-0500","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["eucabot(eucabot)","neil(neil)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/14368/comment/29624","id":"29624","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucabot","name":"eucabot","key":"eucabot","accountId":"557058:007ef05d-c772-4437-b383-d2b42d2a88a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Eucalyptus Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"body":"Originally posted by Arwin Tugade on 2012-04-05T20:10:46.922769+00:00\n\nVersion: 2.0.3\nOS: Centos 5.7\nMode: Managed-Novlan\nSetup: Multicluster\n\nOn this version of Eucalyptus, I've been able to reproduce this behavior consistently in a test cluster.
