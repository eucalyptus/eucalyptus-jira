It uses a designated computer in your datacenter (called a watcher node) and the Amazon Web Services APIs to remotely discover and collect information about your AWS resources. You configure the AWS Management Pack to discover information about your AWS resources by running the Operations Manager Add Monitoring Wizard.\r\n\r\nYou can use the AWS Management Pack to monitor the following AWS resources:\r\n\r\n* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances\r\n* Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes\r\n* Elastic Load Balancing\r\n* AWS Elastic Beanstalk\r\n* AWS CloudFormation stacks\r\n* Auto Scaling groups and Availability Zones\r\n\r\nThe AWS Management Pack uses Amazon CloudWatch metrics and alarms to monitor AWS resources. Amazon CloudWatch metrics appear in Microsoft System Center as performance counters, while Amazon CloudWatch alarms appear as alerts.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-24","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Eucalyptus Management Pack for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12100":"0|i00sh3:","customfield_10000":"10007_*:*_1_*:*_434778940_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_2_*:*_127359096546","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":"2013-05-31T11:58:38.818-0500","customfield_10002":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10000","value":"Customer Affecting","id":"10000"}],"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":["Image-Management-PM"],"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["hspencer(hspencer)"],"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_10117":null,"environment":"*HA and non-HA*","customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-6418/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
