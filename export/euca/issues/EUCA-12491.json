NC does not attempt to adjust to changes in disk availability, it assumes that the disk limits it was configured with -- either automatically on first start or manually through configuration -- correspond to storage capacity available on the node. However, there are many ways in which this assumption may not hold true, so a number of actions could be taken to avoid the dramatic consequences of running out of disk:\r\n* Best practices for setting up Node Controllers, as documented in the Install Guide, should include isolating the storage that NC depends upon from other processes on the system or avoiding processes with unconstrained disk usage. Putting instance store onto a dedicated disk partition is one way to do that, with other benefits, too.\r\n* Best practice for monitoring Node Controllers, as documented in the Admin Guide, should include keeping track of disk space on the NCs, to ensure that space that is reserved for instance storage is always available.\r\n* Request an *improvement to NC* so it either identifies the problem and flags it or even reacts to it. This would have to be designed carefully as sudden resource availability changes on the back-end can have undesirable effects up front.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-06-22T16:27:58.709-0500","updated":"2016-06-22T16:27:58.709-0500"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-12491/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
