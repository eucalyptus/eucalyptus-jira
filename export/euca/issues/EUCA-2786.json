In that case, Amazon cloud returns List keys(objects) response in sorted order whereas Walrus cloud doesn't. This creates lot of problems when the cloud has more than 1000 objects. \n\nIf a cloud bucket contains more than 1000 objects, List object query will return only 1000 objects max in a single response. In order to query the rest of the keys we need to set the marker tag to the last key of the first response and query again. Since the first response itself is not in sorted order, there is no guarantee that the last key is actually in the correct position. Thus we may loose some keys. This scenario works perfect with Amazon cloud buckets. I'll try to explain this scenario with an example,\n\nConsider following keys are present in a bucket (Just for example and not real time scenario)\n\n1. m\n2. n\n3. g\n4. a\n5. d\n6. b\n7. k\n8. c\n\nand consider Amazon restricts only 5 keys maximum(not 1000) while listing. In this case, if I query for the first time, It is returning like,\n\n1. m\n2. n\n3. g\n4. a\n5. d\n\nwhich is not in sorted order, hence if I use the key 'd' as the marker and query for the next result, after that it is sorted and the result is given like,\n\n6. g\n7. m\n8. n\n9. k\n\nWhere 'b' and 'c' are missing. And also the previous keys are duplicated. \n\nThis issue can be reproduced very easily. I'm using eucalyptus-walrus-2.0.3. This issue happens even in CloudBerry explorer.\n\nHope this information helps.\n\nPlease see the Amazon S3 guidelines here: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/index.html?RESTBucketGET.html\n\nI have also posted this issue in Amazon S3 forum, please see the link\nhttps://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=80955\n\nI tested this with Fedora but i believe this bug will also be in Ubuntu.
