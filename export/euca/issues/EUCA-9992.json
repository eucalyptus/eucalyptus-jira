install an ebtables rule to 'fake' any ARP request for the router configured in the network JSON to map back to the NC bridge device to which a VM is attached.  In this way, VM default GW traffic will instead be directed at the NC bridge, and the NC will then route the traffic coming from VMs using its system routing table and euca specific IP tables mods for VMs.  When running in this mode, you need to choose an IP for 'Gateway' in your network config JSON that is not in use anywhere else in the system - if the IP is in use elsewhere, then you will encounter the situation described in this email (among others, likely!).  For most setups, where there is not a complete physical infrastructure installed for the cloud private network address space, this is the right configuration (FAKE_ROUTER=Y, choose unused IP for the cluster subnet 'Gateway').  \r\n\r\nThe other configuration requires that your physical network infrastructure has a fully configured network scenario for your private IP space (physical routers in place, with knowledge of all cluster private networks, and rules for forwarding/natting private traffic externally or to other private IP spaces, etc.)  In this case, one would set FAKE_ROUTER=N and then use the real router IP as 'Gateway' for each cluster subnet in the network JSON.\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies the situation a bit!  \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDan","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=nurmi","name":"nurmi","key":"nurmi","accountId":"557058:68718820-f5e0-4305-a46c-f867a6bc9565","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Daniel Nurmi","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2014-10-03T15:21:50.668-0500","updated":"2014-10-03T15:21:50.668-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/32529/comment/77161","id":"77161","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tony","name":"tony","key":"tony","accountId":"557058:353956db-b78c-4f3b-9096-f8f58e6709c8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tony Beckham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"[~jmille], I've assigned back to you to take action based @nurmi's latest comment.

blinds my instance.\r\n\r\nThat said, in the documentation you are (or the doc team but, they write what you say I guess) is it clearly said :\r\n{code}\r\nEach NC must have an interface configured with an IP on a VM public and a VM private network (which can be the same network).\r\nThere must be unused IP addresses on the VM public network for Eucalyptus to assign VM elastic IPs\r\nThere must be unused IP addresses on the VM private network for Eucalyptus to assign VM private IPs\r\nThere must be IP connectivity from each NC machine (where eucanetd runs) and the CLC, for metadata re-directs for 169.254.169.254 to the active CLC to function.\r\nThere must be a functioning router in place for the private network. This router will be the default gateway for VM instances.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAs an end-user, I would completely do that : EDGE allows me not to rely on a real routing device (switch with L3 capacity or full-router), instead of the CC as done before. The documentation itself explains that, clearly, and we do in the code the complete opposite. Plus, the variable is not documented, and doesn't appear even in TRACE log level.\r\n\r\nI don't understand also where I am supposed to set the FAKE_ROUTER property? I would have that on the NC config file, but why did you say also to have it in the network config JSON ?\r\n\r\nI am going to try that on PRC and EMEA replica. If that does it, will do the necessary to have doc fixed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jmille","name":"jmille","key":"jmille","accountId":"557058:c742fd37-495a-4568-b828-6a07815887c6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4a94ed6572382b1b49af7af7926e2af3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djmille%26avatarId%3D13903%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4a94ed6572382b1b49af7af7926e2af3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djmille%26avatarId%3D13903%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4a94ed6572382b1b49af7af7926e2af3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djmille%26avatarId%3D13903%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/4a94ed6572382b1b49af7af7926e2af3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djmille%26avatarId%3D13903%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"John

network configured which can be used as the default GW for each cluster subnet (or tiered routers, etc).  in that case, you would configure the real router IP as 'Gateway' in the network JSON and set FAKE_ROUTER=N in each NC's eucalyptus.conf.  you would use this configuration if you have such a network in place, and wish to use it (and perhaps have other non-euca networks to which you would like direct VM access)\r\n\r\n2) you do not have a real router/physical network configured completely for the private VM network, in which case you would opt to use the eucalyptus facilities for handling private VM traffic.  in that case, you would configure an unused IP as 'Gateway' in the network JSON and configure FAKE_ROUTER=Y (or leave it unset/undefined, since the defauilt is FAKE_ROUTER=Y) on each NC's eucalyptus.conf.  \r\n\r\nI believe the initial consensus was that option 2) should be the 'default' common case, as it requires less up front work (i.e. getting a fully configured private network set up for VMs) and is more in line with previous modes which didn't require such a setup, but I'm of course open to changing defaults.\r\n\r\nIn either case, I do agree that the docs need an
