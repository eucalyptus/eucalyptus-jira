It mainly involves taking the existing init scripts' code and moving it into several places:\r\n\r\n# Code that attempts to start other services or which checks if other services are running can be removed and replaced with Wants= dependencies in their unit files files.  (see {{systemd.service(5)}})\r\n# Code that attempts to set ulimit values can be removed and replaced with limit directives in their unit files.  (see {{systemd.exec(5)}})\r\n# Code that attempts to set sysctl values can be removed and replaced with a file under /usr/lib/sysctl.d that begins with \"60-\".  We will need to figure out how to ensure these are applied after installation, such as by asking people to run {{sysctl --system}} or reboot before running services.\r\n# For the NC and CC, the remaining code that cannot be removed can go into a new {{/usr/bin/eucalyptus-node}} or {{/usr/bin/eucalyptus-cluster}} executable that creates httpd.conf or the like and then execs httpd.\r\n# For the CLC, the upgrade code will need to move to another executable that either people call themselves or we automate with a oneshot eucalyptus-upgrade.service file that triggers with ConditionPathExists=/etc/eucalyptus/.upgrade.\r\n# The remainder of the eucalyptus-cloud init script can be removed.  That service's unit file can simply obtain CLOUD_OPTS with an EnvironmentFile= directive and then call eucalyptus-cloud.  We will need to ensure that the C bootstrapping code can locate JAVA_HOME without assistance from its caller.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-16T15:34:58.737-0600","updated":"2015-11-16T15:34:58.737-0600"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
