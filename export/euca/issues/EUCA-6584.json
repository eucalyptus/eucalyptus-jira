The id here, of course, is 'id=dashboard-netsec-keypair'.\n\nThis bug was filed to point out the inconsistency of the way elements can be accessed on the Dashboard.\nI currently run selenium tests that access the elements just like you described. However, from the perspective of testability and maintaining the selenium code throughout the future release cycles it may be worth it to make things as uniform as possible.\n\n[~kgill], maybe you can shed some light on what would be affected in the code if \n\n<div id=\"something\">\n<div class=\"status-readout\">\n<span>some number</span>\nSome text\n</div>\n</div>\n\non some count items on the Dashboard would be changed to match\n\n<div id=\"something\" class=\"status-readout\">\n<span>some number</span>\nSome text\n</div>\n\nThank you,\nAlice ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=alice","name":"alice","key":"alice","accountId":"557058:5b1ee660-a351-4b5c-b5b0-22efc33ccfe4","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2cf26ec8e139ffc4e70a1bf036738b53?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dalice%26avatarId%3D14400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2cf26ec8e139ffc4e70a1bf036738b53?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dalice%26avatarId%3D14400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2cf26ec8e139ffc4e70a1bf036738b53?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dalice%26avatarId%3D14400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2cf26ec8e139ffc4e70a1bf036738b53?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dalice%26avatarId%3D14400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Alice Hubenko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-12T11:55:58.791-0500","updated":"2013-09-12T11:55:58.791-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-6584/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
