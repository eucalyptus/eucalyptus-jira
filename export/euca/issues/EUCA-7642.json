This script is run to keep a monitor on the health of our storage in the cloud.\r\n\r\nWhen monitoring script check whether the cloud  can create EBS volume and Snapshot from it using NetApp Clustered Ontap, it usually destroys EBS volume, but leaves Snap-volume and EBS LUN to the storage system in the end.\r\n\r\nFor example, we see this:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nVserver Path State Mapped Type Size\r\n--------- ------------------------------- ------- -------- -------- --------\r\nacme10 /vol/snap_00893AD3/lun1 online unmapped linux 1GB\r\nacme10 /vol/snap_024B3F42/lun1 online unmapped linux 1GB\r\nacme10 /vol/snap_14223DF9/lun1 offline unmapped linux 1GB\r\nacme10 /vol/snap_16E7400C/lun1 online unmapped linux 1GB\r\nacme10 /vol/snap_17C44116/lun1 offline unmapped linux 1GB\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIt definitely checks everything correctly, but when it is time to clean things out, It sometimes get this snap-lun offine, sometimes it even cannot do that. And sometimes it destroys that volume and LUN.\r\n\r\nThese LUNs are removed from Euca databases, so Euca thinks that they are destroyed, but they are left to the disk and has to be removed manually.\r\n\r\nIt might be that some procedures might take some time. And our testing script has a shorter \"wait\" time and previous operation is still under progress when next operation is attempted and hence causes volume and LUN removal to fail.\r\n\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=swathi","name":"swathi","key":"swathi","accountId":"557058:ab7e71b5-781c-49ea-9f4d-ea9148c88f03","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Swathi

I just skimmed through the logs and assuming that snapshot deletion was attempted while these logs were being captured, I expected to see log messages like the one above but did not find even a single one. When the user submits a delete snapshot request to the CLC, it should issue a delete snapshot request to the SC (cluster) that the snapshot was first created in and follow it by issuing the same request to SCs in the remaining clusters.
