It seemed that there was a leftover process running that was accessing the filesystem /dev/drbd1, that kept Walrus from failing over.  After the process stopped (not sure when), failover completed as normal.  We think the open process was fsck because when the /etc/fstab entry was initially set up for the mount point for DRBD, it had the value of 1 for both the dump and fsck options (5th and 6th columns).  After the first failover test was done, fsck began to run, but was killed.  Cloud seemed to be in normal operating state.\r\n\r\nOur [documentation|http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/3.2/ig/config_drbd.html#config_drbd] mentions to use the value of 0 for these options.  This was updated sometime after the primary to secondary CLC/Walrus failover was attempted.  Plan to put in documentation request for adding additional information in the Installation Guide, explaining the importances of having the value 0 for dump and fsck options in /etc/fstab in regards to the drbd mount point for Walrus
