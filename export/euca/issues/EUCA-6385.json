I would like to split this into two scenarios. 1. Optimizing snapshot creation in a single-cluster mode. 2. Discussing the semantics and expectations in multi-cluster mode. Both legitimate requests, but I suspect there are more implications we need to think about to really understand the pros and cons. This has the potential to cause users be disappointed with their administrators, if the settings are changed mid-way (and hence affecting the availability of a snapshot in different clusters based on the creation of the snapshot and the then current setting on shouldtransfersnapshot). Another way to look at this would be to consider supporting an operation where the user (not the admin) will be able to mark certain snapshots as \"local\". The advantage being that an admin setting / resetting the parameter will not affect the behavior perceived by the users w.r.t. snapshot availability across clusters for later use. \n\nOf course the flip side will be that if at a later stage a user wants a snapshot that is marked as \"local\" be available in a different cluster, she will need to explicitly create a volume off of the local snapshot, and then create another snapshot based on this volume, but this time without the \"local\" tag. \n\nWould the above proposal address the pain point you are trying to solve for the user / customer? I'm just brainstorming on different user experiences and the pain points without thinking about feasibility / implementation complexity yet. \n\nThanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=shashi","name":"shashi","key":"shashi","accountId":"557058:cc7ee5dc-1d4f-46c5-8068-6ae350275ba6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Shashi Mysore","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-01T03:33:00.378-0500","updated":"2013-06-01T03:33:00.378-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-6385/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
