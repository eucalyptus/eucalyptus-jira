This was odd since the OS was exactly the same version on both components.\r\n\r\nThe issues came from some Cisco hardware (it was the network fabric for UCS) not handling well the mixed IGMP version: in our testing only the v3 components were able to communicate with each other, and the v2 were simply left out (the route was filtering the v2 messages out).\r\n\r\nHopefully some newer version of the firmware will fix this issue, but one workaround we found was to force v3 at the OS level. The command to force it is:\r\n\r\necho 3 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/force_igmp_version\r\n\r\nI think forcing the same version by default on all component would avoid long tcpdump session and long
