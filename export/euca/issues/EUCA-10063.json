[~dannurmi]:\r\n\r\nBTW - the reason that rule is causing this behavior is that, in this case (server A, server B):\r\n\r\nserver A priv. tries to connect to server B pub\r\n  - packet has server A priv. src, server B pub dst packet hits CC\r\n  - CC re-writes dst to server B priv.\r\n  - packet still has server A priv. src server B accepts and responds to server A src.\r\n  - resp. packet has server B priv. src server A priv. dst failzor (send/resp packets do not match for the connection)\r\n\r\nwe need for the communication to be symmetric - but the SNAT rule is explicitly stripping the application of SNAT when a packet is originating from a sec. group subnet and destined for the same subnet.  without the '! -d ...' in the rule, then the src is re-written as well as the dst, and all

elastic IP\r\n   - this rule has no regression potential, as it just sets an internal to IPT packet mark\r\n\r\nb) replace the rule in POST chain that was previously 'if VMsrc==VMdst, apply SNAT' to 'if VMsrc and mark is set, apply SNAT'.  the new rule is a superset of the old rule, but also triggers any time a packet is originating from the private subnet destined for a public IP (due to change a) above), which is the case we're dealing with here.\r\n\r\nThis solution should not regress the following fixes, which are the chain of events that led to the current problem: \r\n\r\nEUCA-9551\r\n   - issue was when tunnels were employed, packets passed through the CC filters even if src/dst were in the same SG (fix was to introduce the !-d <secG subnet> to the SNAT rule).  the new rule does not interfere with this fix\r\n\r\nEUCA-9690\r\n  - issue was that, when a VM tried to hit its own public IP, the new SNAT rule from 9551 was causing connection fail.  New rule (item b) above) is a superset catch for this fix\r\n\r\nempirically, the old ruleset for an ELIP was:\r\n\r\n-A PREROUTING -d 173.205.188.113/32 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.200.29.31\r\n-A POSTROUTING -s 10.200.29.31/32 -d 10.200.29.31/32 -j SNAT --to-source 173.205.188.113\r\n-A POSTROUTING -s 10.200.29.31/32 ! -d 10.200.29.0/25 -j SNAT --to-source 173.205.188.113\r\n-A OUTPUT -d 173.205.188.113/32 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.200.29.31\r\n\r\nthe new ruleset for an ELIP is:\r\n\r\n-A PREROUTING -s 10.200.0.0/16 -d 173.205.188.129/32 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x15/0xffffffff\r\n-A PREROUTING -d 173.205.188.129/32 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.200.33.231\r\n-A POSTROUTING -s 10.200.33.231/32 -m mark --mark 0x15 -j SNAT --to-source 173.205.188.129\r\n-A POSTROUTING -s 10.200.33.231/32 ! -d 10.200.33.128/25 -j SNAT --to-source 173.205.188.129\r\n-A OUTPUT -s 10.200.0.0/16 -d 173.205.188.129/32 -j MARK --set-xmark 0x15/0xffffffff\r\n-A OUTPUT -d 173.205.188.129/32 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.200.33.231\r\n\r\n\r\nRegression testing:\r\n\r\nI suggest a thorough testing of any VM->VM communication testing that we have, although the only real change in behavior should only trigger for \"VM -> ELIP of another VM\" connections.
