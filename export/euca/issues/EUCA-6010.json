I found where to look and see if we are on a page other than the first one and do the same short-circuiting of the reload in that case. Quick and dirty, but it will fix this bug's literal interpretation. \n\nThe jQuery datatables plugin knows how to save state and return to that if the page is reloaded, including returning to the page you were on and sort order and such, but it seems unable to do that the way we're feeding the data to it. The real solution might have to wait until we are fully implemented with Backbone and getting change events pushed in, and can remove jQuery.dataTables. \n\n\"Fixed\" in:\ncommit 93eab32481b354183f469b2e388396dd4b303945\nAuthor: Jerry Pommer <jpommer@gmail.com>\nDate:   Sun May 5 13:29:44 2013 -0500\n\nLet's discuss this one Monday if we want to pursue it further, given the current time constraints.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jpommer","name":"jpommer","key":"jpommer","accountId":"557058:3f09f5da-413f-44e2-a66b-4378792969a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b58740b331c6718d35493d91e8804f51?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jerry Pommer","active":false,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2013-05-05T13:35:15.978-0500","updated":"2013-05-05T13:35:15.978-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/21065/comment/45127","id":"45127","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=alice","name":"alice","key":"alice","accountId":"557058:5b1ee660-a351-4b5c-b5b0-22efc33ccfe4","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2cf26ec8e139ffc4e70a1bf036738b53?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dalice%26avatarId%3D14400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2cf26ec8e139ffc4e70a1bf036738b53?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dalice%26avatarId%3D14400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2cf26ec8e139ffc4e70a1bf036738b53?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dalice%26avatarId%3D14400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/2cf26ec8e139ffc4e70a1bf036738b53?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dalice%26avatarId%3D14400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Alice Hubenko","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Verified on Volumes page that after changing page table does not \"jump back\".
