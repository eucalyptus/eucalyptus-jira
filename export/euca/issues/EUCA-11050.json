The first value is stored in the db (eucalyptus_cloud/absolute_metric_history), and no absolute metric is computed at this time.  The second value updates the first value when put in and the difference is stored as a cloudwatch metric after a put metric data call.\r\n\r\nOriginally for new values coming in, the algorithm was: search for an existing value, if found update it and \"put metric data\" the diff, otherwise insert the value.  This pattern required a lot of search/[update/insert] calls.\r\n\r\nTo speed the process up, since generally system metrics are all updated at the same time, the following algorithm was implemented.\r\n\r\nDo a full table retrieval of data from the absolute_metric_history table, compare against new values, update old values in place, remove from the new values in memory.  What is left is then new values to be inserted.\r\n\r\nTesting these values on 2 machines with 1000 instances worth of mock data over a 24 hour period has the original method take up to 3 minutes to process data.  (Overlapping the allowed 1 minute alloted time).
