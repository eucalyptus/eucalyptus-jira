Database tables and related operations for Igroup management are going away in 3.3. Design around Igroup naming, creation and deletion is also different: \n\n* Pre 3.3 Igroups were created on a per volume basis. This resulted in as many Igroups as the number of ebs volumes the cloud ever saw. Attach operation for the same volume to different nodes meant that the Igroup had to be modified accordingly (on the SAN and the DB) to contain the right IQN every single time one of these requests came by. SAN and DB had to be synced at all times or there could be failures around Igroup management on the SAN. All this boils down to a large number of operations that can be avoided. In 3.3 Igroups will be created on a per initiator basis, i.e. a different Igroup will be created for a every initiator (SC or NC). Each Igroup will contain only that initiator's IQN for which it was created. Igroup name will be the same as the initiator IQN. It makes it easier to map initiator IQNs to Igroups and hopefully looks less confusing than the random hashes that were used previously.\n\n* Pre 3.3 Igroups were not cleaned up resulting in a large number of Igroups on both SAN and DB. In 3.3 Igroups will be added, removed and reused as required. An Igroup will be created during attach or snapshot process if one does not exist for the initiator. It will be deleted when its not being used. This should keep the number of Igroups on the SAN in check.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=swathi","name":"swathi","key":"swathi","accountId":"557058:ab7e71b5-781c-49ea-9f4d-ea9148c88f03","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/d6487612d6674329ecef11be0a95552b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dswathi%26avatarId%3D17901%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Swathi
