As I understand, by default, bundling happens in /tmp by default. It's\nmore problematic in case of eustore because the limited domain of possible\nfilenames. In case with euca2ools, the randomness of the filenames create in\n/tmp is (somewhat) created by the fact that an attacker can't predict what\nimage (which what filename) a user is going to bundle. In case of eustore, the\nguess is limited by the number of images in eustore store. So, an attacker\ncould pre-create files with all such names in advance in /tmp and just wait to\nsee which ones the user will actually use.\n\n  \n  \nOn Thu Mar 15 13:01:17 2012, david.kavanagh wrote:\n\n> The ec2 and euca2ools bundle to specific directories based on the\n\n> parameters (such as -p and -d).

As I understand, by default, bundling happens in /tmp by default. It's\nmore problematic in case of eustore because the limited domain of possible\nfilenames. In case with euca2ools, the randomness of the filenames create in\n/tmp is (somewhat) created by the fact that an attacker can't predict what\nimage (which what filename) a user is going to bundle. In case of eustore, the\nguess is limited by the number of images in eustore store. So, an attacker\ncould pre-create files with all such names in advance in /tmp and just wait to\nsee which ones the user will actually use.\n\n\nOn Thu Mar 15 13:01:17 2012, david.kavanagh wrote:\n> The ec2 and euca2ools bundle to specific directories based on the\n> parameters (such as -p and -d).
