No runtime issues came up with JibX and the cloud performed as expected for all tested operations.\n\nHere's some of the problems I ran into with other dependency updates:\n\nUpdating Guava r09 -> 14.0.1:\n\nNeed to use CacheBuilder instead of MapMaker[1] (which is deprecated and all caching code has been pulled out)\n\nmakeListeners has been removed completely, but you can use listenInPoolThread method from JdkFutureAdapters, though this is not recommended[2].\n\nHibernate 3.5.6-Final -> 4.2.0.CR2:\n\nJbossCache to Infinispan migration is required. There are no immediately obvious reasons that we could not use Hibernate 4.2.0.CR2, though it looks like it will require a bit of code work. No unreasonable dependencies are introduced. So maybe someone (Steve?) should make a branch that compiles against the new version to do further evaluation?\n\nUpdating Groovy:\n\nI did a binary search of versions from 1.7.2 through 2.1.1 and confirmed that 1.7.2 is the *only* version of groovy that will build our code. Starting with 1.7.3 and all newer versions our code fails to compile with the same error. When updating our 1.7.2 groovy jar the follow errors are seen. The sad part is while it mentions the Java stubs to view they are not retained. Also, version 1.7.2 does not provide the ant task arguments to retain stubs. I built with a newer version of groovy with stub retention (which of course failed to compile) and I was able to view the stubs. There was nothing that seemed obviously wrong to me, though I'm no Java expert.\n\n{noformat}\norg.codehaus.groovy.control.MultipleCompilationErrorsException: startup failed:\nCompile error during compilation with javac.\n/root/euca_builder/eee/eucalyptus/clc/modules/configuration/stubs/com/eucalyptus/config/ConfigurationMessage.java:10: error: cannot find symbol\n@com.eucalyptus.component.ComponentId$ComponentMessage(value=com.eucalyptus.config.ConfigurationService.class) public class ConfigurationMessage\n^\nsymbol:   class ComponentId$ComponentMessage\nlocation: package com.eucalyptus.component\n/root/euca_builder/eee/eucalyptus/clc/modules/configuration/stubs/com/eucalyptus/config/PropertiesMessage.java:10: error: cannot find symbol\n@com.eucalyptus.component.ComponentId$ComponentMessage(value=com.eucalyptus.empyrean.Empyrean$PropertiesService.class) public class PropertiesMessage\n^\nsymbol:   class ComponentId$ComponentMessage\nlocation: package com.eucalyptus.component\nNote: /root/euca_builder/eee/eucalyptus/clc/modules/configuration/src/main/java/com/eucalyptus/config/ConfigurationManager.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.\nNote: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.\n{noformat}\n\n[1] https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/MapMakerMigration\n[2] https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=317","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mspaulding","name":"mspaulding","key":"mspaulding","accountId":"557058:fa0a9514-613e-4c4f-8872-2880096382a5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/49cba835af4c73beefe1c9c630cb2021?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmspaulding%26avatarId%3D13100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/49cba835af4c73beefe1c9c630cb2021?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmspaulding%26avatarId%3D13100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/49cba835af4c73beefe1c9c630cb2021?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmspaulding%26avatarId%3D13100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/49cba835af4c73beefe1c9c630cb2021?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmspaulding%26avatarId%3D13100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Spaulding","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-19T17:35:56.654-0500","updated":"2013-03-19T17:35:56.654-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/20029/comment/41981","id":"41981","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mspaulding","name":"mspaulding","key":"mspaulding","accountId":"557058:fa0a9514-613e-4c4f-8872-2880096382a5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/49cba835af4c73beefe1c9c630cb2021?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmspaulding%26avatarId%3D13100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/49cba835af4c73beefe1c9c630cb2021?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmspaulding%26avatarId%3D13100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/49cba835af4c73beefe1c9c630cb2021?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmspaulding%26avatarId%3D13100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/49cba835af4c73beefe1c9c630cb2021?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmspaulding%26avatarId%3D13100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Matt Spaulding","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ken and Steve informed me we may already have a patch for the changes needed to upgrade Guava.
