it seems to me that the distributed cache in the individual virtual machines is the main thing which is providing value.  The distributed cache is larger than the central cache on the SC (since each individual VM has it's own cache).  The caches on the VMs don't overlap (since they each write to their own EBS backing file).  As such I don't think caches beyond the buffer cache in the local VM add value and they might as well be turned off.\n\nThe local cache on the local VM is under direct control of the of the operating system.  This means that if a system call such as sync/fsync is made the write buffers will be flushed through to the underlying device.  However, in this case the underlying device is backed by a file on an NFS drive.  This file will not be flushed and so data which the application thinks is forced to disk storage has not actually been flushed.  \n\nFor these two reasons I think the solution to this problem is either for Eucalyptus to stop caching of underlying files or to document that EBS backing files should be kept on uncached disks.

Is dd using skip/seek during disk creation.  \n\nThis still wouldn't solve the underlying problem which is that \na) the guest operating systems need to be tolerant of delay on the iSCSI disks\nb) the storage controller should ensure some kind of real time responsiveness promises for all of the guest operating systems.  \n\nBy real time I *do not* mean fast; but just that it should continue to respond in some way or other, e.g. at least one network packet a second per guest machine.  Otherwise there's no way for the guest machine to be sure that the EBS disk is still there, but just slow.
