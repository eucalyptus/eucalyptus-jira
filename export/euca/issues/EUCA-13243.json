It never seems to fail twice in a row.\r\n\r\nThe SC calls this function in only 2 cases:\r\n# look for Ceph images and snapshots to clean up, and \r\n# check for the existence of a volume with the same ID as the one it's about to create\r\nCase 1 is not a problem because the cleaner task will run again on its normal schedule and clean up when the call succeeds the next time.\r\nCase 2's chances of occurring are microscopic, a volume ID collision at the same time as this listing error. Even if it did, attempting to create a volume of the same name as an existing volume will cause a Ceph exception, properly failing the volume creation.\r\n\r\nThus, marking this issue as Minor.\r\n\r\nThis error has been noted before in EUCA-10232, which resulted in a bug fix that [~swathi] pushed upstream to Ceph. The current error is in that same code, the {{list()}} method in {{https://github.com/ceph/rados-java/blob/master/src/main/java/com/ceph/rbd/Rbd.java}}, so maybe the fix is incomplete or something
