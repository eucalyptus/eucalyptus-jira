be explicitly specified after Eucalyptus has started.\n\nSo having eucalyptus-cloud depending on a running tgt would make the implementation specific to be backend being used.\n\nBut we should either instruct the user to run \"service tgtd start\" (or whatever the equivalent is) or the SC backend logic for overlay (or DAS) should do it itself (i.e. no SAN).\n\nThat way, \"service tgtd stop\" will be called on shutdown.\n\nIn 3.2, we have changed when we create tgt targets, so that if all volumes are detached, no tgt state is left behind, which should also aid this situation, but it is a good idea to call \"service tgtd start\" (or whatever the distro equivalent is), instead of running tgtd directly.\n\nThe question is when...Doing it at process startup is premature, since we do not know

If it is using TGTD and the tgtd service isn't running, the storage controller should not startup and should either completely fail or, proabably better, loop printing out \"no TGT daemon runing and storage configured using iSCSI; sleeping\".\n\nIf the default install script turns on the Eucalpytus services, then I don't  see anything wrong with depending on tgtd and turning it on, even if it turns out not to be needed.
