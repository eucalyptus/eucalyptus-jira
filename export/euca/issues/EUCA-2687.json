The difference is that *no* instances succeed when I run with a -n > 30. This is rather unexpected.\n\nBTW, thank you, adjusted the bug title.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucabot","name":"eucabot","key":"eucabot","accountId":"557058:007ef05d-c772-4437-b383-d2b42d2a88a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Eucalyptus Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"created":"2012-07-11T07:52:17.929-0500","updated":"2012-07-11T07:52:17.929-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/14264/comment/29321","id":"29321","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucabot","name":"eucabot","key":"eucabot","accountId":"557058:007ef05d-c772-4437-b383-d2b42d2a88a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Eucalyptus Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"body":"Originally posted by Etienne Goyer on 2010-03-24T20:59:33.504799+00:00\n\nIt is probably the same root cause, though.  Does \"euca-run-instances -n 30 ...\" works if you increase the value of VNET_ADDRSPERNET and do a clean restart?  If yes, then it's not really a bug, although I guess euca2ools should say something meaningful about why no instance are being started.\n\ni am not sure what the correct behavior should be in this case.  Should Eucalyptus actually run instances until it runs out of private address in the security group, or should it reject the entire request (like it seems to be doing here).  My guess is that it should do the later, and return that it does not have resources to complete the request (or something along that line).  The Eucalyptus people would know for sure what the intended behavior is supposed to be.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucabot","name":"eucabot","key":"eucabot","accountId":"557058:007ef05d-c772-4437-b383-d2b42d2a88a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Eucalyptus Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"created":"2012-07-11T07:52:18.593-0500","updated":"2012-07-11T07:52:18.593-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/14264/comment/29322","id":"29322","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucabot","name":"eucabot","key":"eucabot","accountId":"557058:007ef05d-c772-4437-b383-d2b42d2a88a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Eucalyptus Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"body":"Originally posted by C de-Avillez on 2010-03-24T21:23:16.197207+00:00\n\nI am not sure either. But we do have some options:\n\n1. if rejecting all requests, it should print out a reason, and end immediately;\n2. if accepting up to (VNET_ADDRSPERNET - 3), then it should print out messages for the refusals (and not even try to start them) (but I guess there is a timing issue here). This is what happens when you are already at the limit, and you try another euca-run-instance on the same group.\n\nBut to accept all requests and keep them all Pending for many minutes before marking all Terminated is plainly wrong.
