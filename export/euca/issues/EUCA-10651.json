A service instance, managed similarly to the imaging worker, or an ELB instance. Being able to spin up at least one to service the entire cloud, or optionally more than one (eg, two in each AZ). This instance would service requests external to the cloud, as well as requests from within the cloud. Being able to reserve one public IP for each DNS service instance (eg, through a new property setting) might be a necessity.\r\n\r\n2. Running it natively on the NC when in EDGE mode, or on the CC when in MANAGED or MANAGED-NOVLAN mode, primarily to service the instances.\r\n\r\n3. Running it natively on the CLC and/or UFS components. Similar to the first option, only more static (less cloud-y) in design.\r\n\r\nIn testing this, it seems a trivial configuration (based off the info located at [this link|https://calomel.org/unbound_dns.html]) might look something like this:\r\n\r\n{code}server:\r\n        interface: 0.0.0.0\r\n        access-control: 0.0.0.0/0 allow\r\n        domain-insecure: \"example.com\"\r\n        domain-insecure: \"internal\"\r\n\r\nstub-zone:\r\n     name: \"example.com\"\r\n     stub-addr: 10.104.10.12\r\nstub-zone:\r\n     name: \"internal\"\r\n     stub-addr: 10.104.10.12{code}\r\n\r\nThe use of {{domain-insecure}} to selectively allow specific domains managed by Eucalyptus would be needed, since Eucalyptus DNS doesn't appear to support DNSSEC. See [this link|https://www.unbound.net/documentation/howto_turnoff_dnssec.html] for further details. The alternative would be to disable DNSSEC altogether via {{val-permissive-mode}}, which might be a bit heavy-handed. Getting DNSSEC support added to Eucalyptus DNS might be better served in another EUCA.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of performance:\r\n\r\n{code}[root@odc-c-12 ~]# cat queryfile\r\neuca-10-104-3-110.eucalyptus.example.com A\r\neuca-172-27-23-157.eucalyptus.internal A{code}\r\n\r\n{code}[Status] Testing complete (end of file)\r\n\r\nStatistics:\r\n\r\n  Queries sent:
