It runs under its own account (eucaconsole, if I recall correctly) on the system, and it will soon be split into its own base package to make it possible to update more quickly.  That, combined with the fact that the eucalyptus user owns /var/log/eucalyptus, makes sharing that directory rather painful.\n\nWould shipping a eucalyptus-console package that makes syslogd write the user console's logs to /var/log/eucalyptus-console.log be sufficient?\n\nNote to implementer:  don't forget to also include logrotate configuration for it.
