These external cloud images are sized to work with Amazon m1.small which have 8GB root volumes. This means they can not longer be used with the default instance types t1.micro and m1.small within Eucalyptus, which have 5GB root volumes. \r\n\r\nWe should adjust our default instance type sizes to 8GB if we are now going to reference these external cloud images to prevent customer frustration with the failures to start I'm seeing, as well as adjusting other instance types so they remain proportional.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I did just that, I found that this still didn't work, which makes me suspect our \"8\" when adjusting euca image types, is not exactly 8 GiB, or 8589934592 bytes, which is the size of the CentOS 6.6 cloud image I'm trying to run. Or that we have some type of overhead, and a cloud image of exactly 8 GiB will not run in our image types when set to 8 GB.  The error message I get is this:\r\n\"Unable to run instance emi-9d965ae0 in which the size 8589934592 bytes of the instance is greater than the vmType m1.small size 8 GB.\"\r\n\r\nThis should be corrected so that when we set the size of an image type to 8 GB, it can run a cloud image sized to 8GB, as is the case here. This is particularly relevant to this exact size, as I think nearly all external cloud images are built to this 8GB size. But, if we're aware of other standard sizing for external cloud images our customers will use, such as any Windows cloud images if they exist, we should test against and make sure they run too. Of course we should test that all images on the emis.eucalyptus.com page run in the 8GB instance size, or whatever size they claim to be.\r\n\r\nTalked to Vic on this, and he said this might just be a few bytes off. I think if we do have this sort of small overhead, we should invisibly add this to the memory we allocate so that we can run these external cloud images unmodified (except for qcow2 to raw conversion).\r\n\r\nI've confirmed an ability to launch the same image type in instance type resized to have a 9GB or 10G disk.\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=vasya","name":"vasya","key":"vasya","accountId":"557058:1c63481a-0634-4ae7-9004-cb0f143e141f","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Vasiliy

Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hopefully this means easy fix - something we can still get in for 4.1.1?\r\n\r\nI think with our switch to using public 8G images on emis.eucalyptus.com, this issue may be small, but a lot of new people are likely to hit it, and hit it early in the evaluation process, giving them an initial negative experience. I think we should prioritize getting this fixed as a result.\r\n\r\nI alluded to this in my initial comment, but I think we should also probably adjust the default disk size for the t1.micro and m1.small from 5GB to 8GB, once this bug is fixed, so that our smallest images can run the public cloud images, as this is behavior expected to match AWS behavior. And, we should take this time to adjust the size of all other image types proportionally to match, as an 8G to 10G bump as we move up to the next size no longer makes sense.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest 16G as the next bump, then maybe 32G and 64G after that, keeping with binary increments.\r\n\r\nAnd while we're at it, 256G Memory is too small for just about everything now. I don't think CentOS 7 can even start with that amount of memory. We might want to bump t1.micro to 512 and everything above to at least 1G. People can adjust down (that can even be a FastStart option for people evaluating on small systems), but the default should really be more realistic.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-04-20T13:17:04.381-0500","updated":"2015-04-20T13:17:04.381-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/35744/comment/85425","id":"85425","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=viglesias","name":"viglesias","key":"viglesias","accountId":"557058:49b276ff-ebf9-4dd6-ada3-b568a2898707","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/5608e0aa05bd6e5d73b855a08079cceb?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dviglesias%26avatarId%3D10405%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/5608e0aa05bd6e5d73b855a08079cceb?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dviglesias%26avatarId%3D10405%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/5608e0aa05bd6e5d73b855a08079cceb?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dviglesias%26avatarId%3D10405%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/5608e0aa05bd6e5d73b855a08079cceb?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dviglesias%26avatarId%3D10405%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Victor Iglesias","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"4.1.1 is in its final week of QA so this will not make it right now.
