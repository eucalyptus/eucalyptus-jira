I imagine the intent was to select the 'admin' user but the way the code is written the regex could match 'sadminer' for instance, who may or may not have admin credentials.\n\nThis problem manifested when we created some accounts named jdoe_admin.  Even through jdoe_admin was marked as an Administrator since there were no credentials in the database (the user had not retrieved their credentials.zip) euca_conf requests started to fail on the machine.  \n\nThe offending lines seem to be:\nSKEY=$(eval echo $(awk -v field=${FIELD} -F, '/INSERT INTO AUTH_USERS.*admin/ {print $field}' ${DBDIR}/*auth* | head -n 1))\n\nAKEY=$(eval echo $(awk -v field=${FIELD} -F, '/INSERT INTO AUTH_USERS.*admin/ {print $field}' ${DBDIR}/*auth* | head -n 1))\n\nSince the usernames in the files are surrounded by single quotes the following fix seemed to work for us:\n\nReplace:  '/INSERT INTO AUTH_USERS.*admin/ {print $field}' \nWith:  \"/INSERT INTO AUTH_USERS.*'admin'/ {print \\$field}\"\n\nNot sure if that is the best solution.\n\nThanks!","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"getSecretKey()
