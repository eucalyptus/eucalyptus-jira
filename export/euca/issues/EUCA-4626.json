I'd rather it not and that it was configurable. There is a logging configuration but this is simply for the StreamHandler which is sending info to sys.stdout which doesn't work too well when running the Eucalyptus user console as a daemon.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this is to just default to using the handlers.SysLogHandler for logging info from the user console. This is a rather easy change and I have already figured it out. There is an issue out of the box with this fix though.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there logging is started in /usr/bin/euca-console-server which is uses the default handlers.SysLogHandler configuration and isn't stopped after the web application is started. This can cause an issue with the same log line being printed twice to /var/log/messages with standard settings if the handlers.SysLogHandler is configured in /etc/eucalyptus-console/console.ini. If this line is uncommented then it works like a champ.\r\n\r\nThere is also another issue if we attempt to stick with the current formatting line, there is no easy way to filter out text headed to syslog. If we were to remove the date (syslog automatically adds it with the default template) and add something like \"eucalyptus-console:\" to the beginning of the format string a simple filter can be setup. For example:\r\n\r\n{{:programname,isequal,\"eucalyptus-console\"   /var/log/eucalyptus-console.log}}\r\n\r\nWith this we can also use logrotate to rotate logs easily on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nThere's another option if this is not sufficient. The handlers.SysLogHandlers.LOG_LOCAL* can be used to send logs to a direct interface. We can then setup a new template for syslog to use when printing that will print out whatever format that we need it to. I'd much rather have the logging match what the majority of the other programs on the system are producing but if it's configurable then it doesn't really matter to me.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/version/12806","id":"12806","description":"Eucalyptus

We're running 3.4.0 on the ECC, and have observed that some part of the eucalyptus-console is eventually making a syslog call to the kern.emerg(0) syslog level, which by default on CentOS/RHEL (at least) is output directly /dev/console (ssh sessions, terminal sessions, etc) as well as /var/log/messages.  In fact, kern.emerg(0) is the most severe log level, and thus anything going to syslog at that level will be output to *all* configured syslog end-poiints.  Normally, this log level is only used for ultra fatal or important events like system reboots, deep kernel errors, etc, that are so critical that it is deemed necessary to interrupt any logged in sessions with such a message.  Application errors, warnings, etc, do not use kern.emerg(0).\r\n\r\nThe effect of this is that, when users are using the eucalyptus-console, it is very difficult (realistically not possible), to log in  to the server as an admin and perform regular unix tasks like editing files, etc, since the terminal is at steady 'people using console' state of lots of messages scrolling in your terminal.  \r\n\r\nThere is a workaround that I've developed for the ECC so that we can manage the server, which is to throw out messages that match the ones being sent by the eucalyptus console.  This type of filtering is incomplete, but so far has captured at least most of the eucalyptus-console messages that are sent to kern.emerg(0).  These lines in /etc/rsyslog.conf (plus restart of syslog), result in only a few terminal interruption messages per day, with the current ECC console workload.  Note that I consider this a workaround, not a good solution as the filters have to be message specific and could potentially filter out other useful messages from other applications.\r\n\r\n# DAN WAS HERE - rule to try and filter out euca console spamming msgs\r\n:msg, contains, \"error calling\" /var/log/eucaconsoletrap.log\r\n:msg, contains, \"boto server error\" /var/log/eucaconsoletrap.log\r\n:msg, contains, \"403 GET\" /var/log/eucaconsoletrap.log\r\n:msg, contains, \"new ec2 connection\" /var/log/eucaconsoletrap.log\r\n:msg, contains, \"error calling\" ~\r\n:msg, contains, \"boto server error\" ~\r\n:msg, contains, \"403 GET\" ~\r\n:msg, contains, \"new ec2 connection\" ~\r\n\r\nSO - I've seen some discussion of this issue being focused around specific messages, but I believe the right way to think of this is to determine why the eucalyptus-console is (eventually) sending log messages to syslog with kern.emerg(0) level, and replace that with a more standard syslog log level, by default.  In sum, no messages from eucalyptus should be using kern.emerg(0) by default, I believe.\r\n\r\n-D","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=nurmi","name":"nurmi","key":"nurmi","accountId":"557058:68718820-f5e0-4305-a46c-f867a6bc9565","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Daniel
