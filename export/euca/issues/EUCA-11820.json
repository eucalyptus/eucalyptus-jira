(Yes, VMs within the FastStart VM.)\r\n\r\nI've defined: (per step 3)\r\nexport EUCALYPTUS=\"/opt/eucalyptus\"\r\n...because we need to isolate the file tree built by \"make\" so it can be rsync'd to the other nodes in the cloud.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure that will work, because the \"configure\" script and/or \"make ; make install\" still creates files outside $EUCALYPTUS. I'm attaching that list of files here.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've followed the Install Guide at http://docs.hpcloud.com/eucalyptus/4.2.0/#shared/install_section.html , configuring for EDGE mode, skipping the installs of the packages (yum install eucalyptus-___) since I've built the code from source instead.\r\n\r\nI'm also attaching my /opt/eucalyptus/etc/eucalyptus/eucalyptus.conf file.\r\n\r\nI also manually added the eucalyptus group and user, which I think is required when not installing from packages: (not mentioned in the user docs, not sure it should be)\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\ngroupadd -g 700 -r eucalyptus\r\nuseradd -c \"Eucalyptus Daemon User\" -d /opt/eucalyptus/var/lib/eucalyptus -g 700 -r -u 600 eucalyptus\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThe init command failed with:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n# /opt/eucalyptus/usr/sbin/clcadmin-initialize-cloud\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/eucalyptus/usr/sbin/clcadmin-initialize-cloud\", line 28, in <module>\r\n    import argparse\r\nImportError: No module named argparse\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nI also tried: (I don't know if euca_conf is still supported)\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n# euca_conf\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/eucalyptus/usr/sbin/euca_conf\", line 44, in <module>\r\n    from boto.roboto.awsqueryservice import NoCredentialsError\r\nImportError: No module named boto.roboto.awsqueryservice\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this is related to installing into the non-standard $EUCALYPTUS directory (/opt/eucalyptus). \r\nIf true, then either:\r\n# We have to figure out if/how to fix support for non-standard $EUCALYPTUS installs (maybe a separate JIRA issue), or \r\n# We ditch that support, only support installing into '/', and replace the INSTALL step about rsync-ing the $EUCALYPTUS tree to other nodes, with the need to build the code from source on each node of your cloud.\r\n# Or some other option?\r\n\r\nI copied the contents of $EUCALYPTUS/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages into /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages and tried again, but no luck.\r\n\r\nIf my current errors are fixable another way, hopefully someone can assist me here.

I'll verify that.\r\n\r\nBy comparison, building/configuring via the INSTALL(ation Guide) worked fine, with some additional actions I did based on the from the {{Requires:}}, {{%install}} and {{%pre}} sections of the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-rpmspec/master/eucalyptus.spec file, and a few changes to the Installation Guide I will work with the docs team to investigate and adjust. This spec file builds to '/', it doesn't use a non-'/' $EUCALYPTUS directory. So, the build on the first host seems to end up as a configurable cloud node, if we add the other steps done in the spec file. These same steps would have to be done on the other nodes as well.\r\n\r\nAnother option for the INSTALL instructions would be to:\r\n# {{git clone git://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus-rpmspec}}\r\n# Create the SOURCES, BUILD, SPECS directories\r\n# {{rpmbuild -bi eucalyptus.spec}}\r\nThat would perform all the actions that the package build does, but without installing any packages and still allowing build and deploy from source. Then we wouldn't have to duplicate all the steps done by the rpmbuild in text form in the INSTALL file and maintain them.\r\n\r\nInvestigation continues.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-14T03:03:41.719-0600","updated":"2015-12-14T03:14:53.007-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/39911/comment/97016","id":"97016","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yes, there are some bugs in the tools that are not picking up EUCALYPTUS from the environment properly.
