The example would be certain linux kernel module that once loaded they 'taint' the kernel: no kernel OOPS will be analyzed if TAINT will show in the stack trace. We would like something similar, to allow us to identify quickly of such a feature has been enabled.\r\n\r\nIf this is achieved with separate repo, I support them. If this is achieved with a fault that is logged once the cloud start, I support it.
