(use @grze, please)","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"These are the considerations which come to mind in this issue.  The viability of this approach in the implementation is something I cannot determine unilaterally.\n\nSome parameters are set by clients (and esp. UI tools) in a way that the user cannot control (Asgard, ElasticFox, JetS3t come to mind as past examples).  When strict validation is done a request which could otherwise be fulfilled (albeit with a semantic deviation that disregards the unsupported parameter) would fail.  \n\nIn rich clients this can have (and has had) the consequence of some higher-level workflow to fail entirely (and often in ugly ways).  A couple of examples: state caching in Asgard is all-or-nothing start up operation as is tab rendering in ElasticFox.  The end effect is that a swath of functionality, or even the whole tool, is rendered unusable (read: badness).  At first blush, these may seem to be describe operations that result in such dependencies, but that is not strictly true (e.g., there are examples across versions of the EC2 API).  Perhaps that exercise will show it to no longer be the case -- but I wont pursue it unless prompted to do so.\n\nThen, in my view, a service operation implementation has three options:\n# Reject the request with a validation error.\n# Map the unsupported parameter onto a supported and semantically similar functionality.\n# Ignore the unsupported parameter in terms of functionality.\n\nGiven the above experience with clients, I'd ask we ensure that there is a way to configure the system where _any_ well formed request (per the WSDL/Query specification) will be accepted *UNLESS* it is the semantic purpose of the operation to validate the state/existence/happiness of the unsupported parameter:  Behaviour *#1* is optional.  Put another way, strict mode is *off* by default.\n\nThe subtlety that is in play here is some of the parameters to AutoScaling operations are really pass-through parameters for a down stream EC2 service operation.  The wrinkle being that AutoScaling can determine _apriori_ that the parameter is absent (e.g., VPC subnets) with the intention of validating the reference.  However, because of *#2* and *#3* above, this strict (and strictly speaking, correct) interpretation reduces the set of viable requests beyond what is _\"supported\"_ (speaking loosely now).  \n\nI'd argue for #1 and #2 above to be symmetric in the semantics for unsupported parameters between EC2 and AutoScaling.  Since we control the service implementations and their release lifecycles are in lock step,  we know what unsupported EC2 parameter's semantics. Wherever we must silently accept a parameter in EC2 for the sake of client compatibility we should take the same tact in AutoScaling.  And vice versa (the operation validation relation is also reflexive and we have semantic equivalence).\n\nThis position begs a couple of questions:\n# Is lazy/silent validation the only kind of behaviour (e.g., is it @Configurable to be strict)?\n# What happens with the information that an unsupported parameter was used in the lazy/silent mode?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=decker","name":"decker","key":"decker","accountId":"557058:518b1ab0-12c2-4e72-b694-6c07036941a8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"do not want!
