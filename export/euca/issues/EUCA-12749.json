For example, you could install or configure software on newly launched instances, or download log files from an instance before it terminates.\r\n{quote}\r\nThere are three options that are supported currently with lifecycle hooks.  Since we haven't implemented the Lambda service (and SQS/SNS is on the roadmap), only two are viable.\r\n{quote}\r\nAfter you add lifecycle hooks to your Auto Scaling group, they work as follows:\r\n\r\n# Auto Scaling responds to scale out events by launching instances and scale in events by terminating instances.\r\n# Auto Scaling puts the instance into a wait state ({{Pending:Wait}} or {{Terminating:Wait}}). The instance remains in this state until either you tell Auto Scaling to continue or the timeout period ends.\r\n# You can perform a custom action using one or more of the following options:\r\n#* Define a CloudWatch Events target to invoke a Lambda function when a lifecycle action occurs. The Lambda function is invoked when Auto Scaling submits an event for a lifecycle action to CloudWatch Events. The event contains information about the instance that is launching or terminating, and a token that you can use to control the lifecycle action.\r\n#* *Define a notification target for the lifecycle hook, Auto Scaling sends a message to the notification target. The message contains information about the instance that is launching or terminating, and a token that you can use to control the lifecycle action.*\r\n#* *Create a script that runs on the instance as the instance starts. The script can control the lifecycle action using the ID of the instance on which it runs.*\r\n# By default, the instance remains in a wait state for one hour, and then Auto Scaling continues the termination process ({{Pending:Proceed}} or {{Terminating:Proceed}}). If you need more time, you can restart the timeout period by recording a heartbeat. If you finish before the timeout period ends, you can complete the lifecycle action, which continues the termination process.\r\n{quote}","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Support for Auto Scaling Lifecycle Hooks","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12100":"0|i03x8n:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"6_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_2353526229","customfield_10001":"2016-10-12T05:19:43.030-0500","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["hspencer(hspencer)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-12749/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
