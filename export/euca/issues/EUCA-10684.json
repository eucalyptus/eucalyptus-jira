This was due to the fact that eucanetd was unable to bind the interface of the instance (in KVM) to the virtual bridge in Midonet. I don't recall the exact error message, but {{eucanetd.log}} was complaining about not being able to find host A.B.C.D for instance i-12345678. When you look at the hosts within Midonet, we found that the Midonet agent (midolman) reported the name as the hostname of the system, not the IP address (both CLI and the Midonet Manager showed this). When we changed the NC registration to use the FQDN, which matched the hostname reported by the Midonet agent, eucanetd was able to successfully bind the virtual interface of the KVM instance to the Midonet virtual network, and therefore allowing network connectivity to the instances.\r\n\r\nI'm curious how the Euca team got VPCMIDO working with IP addresses to be quite honest, so any insight you have there would be helpful, because as it stands we are unable to upgrade to 4.3 until we get this resolved.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jgallucci32","name":"jgallucci32","key":"jgallucci32","accountId":"557058:1cd98ee4-b2ee-4683-a315-2a6abd75b048","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"John Gallucci","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-07T16:58:02.312-0500","updated":"2016-09-07T16:58:02.312-0500"}],"maxResults":10,"total":10,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-10684/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
