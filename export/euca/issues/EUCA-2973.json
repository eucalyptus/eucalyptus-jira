The reason is lack of ARP announcement from new enabled CC.\r\n\r\nAfter CC failover from A to B, the public IPs and private subnets gateway IPs are bonded and up on new enabled CC-B. But there's no ARP announcement (AKA Gratuitous ARP) sent out from CC-B, so the surrounding hosts and routers still use old IP<->MAC mapping which leads traffic to still go to CC-A. \r\n\r\nThis will be fixed until next ARP request sent from surrounding hosts and routers after current ARP entries time out. Some network devices like Cisco Router takes up to 4 hours(default ARP timeout value) to age ARP entries, which causes long time network break to the cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\nTest steps:\r\n0. \r\nConstantly ping an instance public IP from a host outside the cloud, take 10.68.93.100 as example\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nH:\\>ping 10.68.93.100 -t\r\n Pinging 10.68.93.100 with 32 bytes of data:\r\nReply from 10.68.93.100: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=59\r\nReply from 10.68.93.100: bytes=32 time=1ms TTL=59\r\nReply from 10.68.93.100: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=59\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n1. \r\nOn enabled CC Euca3-FE-2 , check public address.

Nurmi","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"body":"Hey all,\n\nWhat we're likely to add to the code is some logic in the CC that sends unsolicited ARP requests whenever a new 'public' IP gets assigned to a CC interface.  This will cover both the case where a failover occurs, when elastic IPs are assigned across clusters, and in any other scenario where a given IP is used on separate machines.  Interestingly, there is a simple unix command that I believe has already been referenced by someone else that is an easy way to send such an unsolicited arp request:\n\narping -c 2 -U -I <interface> <local ip address in question>\n\nso, if a machine just got '192.168.253.2' assigned to its 'eth0', then \n\narping -c 2 -U -I eth0 192.168.253.2\n\nwill broadcast an unsolicited ARP message that should trigger servers and network devices on that broadcast network to update their arp cache entries. \n\nWhile engineering works on integration into euca, perhaps we can put together a simple script (cronable) that takes the public IPs listed in eucalyptus.conf, plus the public interface, and loops over the IPs periodically.  If this script is run on the CC periodically, it should keep the ARP caches up to date.  Good news is that the command fails if the IP is not currently assigned to the specified interface, so it should be safe to run independently on two separate HA CCs (it will periodically send the unsolicited ARP requests on the CC where the IPs are assigned, and the commands will just fail on the CC that doesn't currently have those public IPs assigned).  Thus it should be safe to run in a loop without needing to interrogate anything from eucalyptus other than 'public interface' and 'public ips'.  What do you think?\n\n-D\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=nurmi","name":"nurmi","key":"nurmi","accountId":"557058:68718820-f5e0-4305-a46c-f867a6bc9565","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Daniel Nurmi","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2012-11-29T12:17:00.324-0600","updated":"2012-11-29T12:17:00.324-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/14659/comment/36541","id":"36541","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dstagnaro","name":"dstagnaro","key":"dstagnaro","accountId":"557058:ab9ac2db-0ce9-444b-b209-d57d16ac0e46","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Darren Stagnaro","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Dan, this is great news.\n\nI think a script would be helpful as it would let us not only get a broader test exposure to the new ARP behavior on the CC, it would also allow some users to move forward with their HA setups.
