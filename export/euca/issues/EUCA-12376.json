tomcat response on CLC is slow), and slow processing (over 8 minutes). Moreover, some MidoNet API calls are failing.\r\n\r\nmidolman on NCs are also having difficulties accessing MidoNet NSDB. midolman interface updater becomes non-responsive, requiring midolman restarts. OVS datapath had a high number of flow entries (800 to 1000), which could have caused by eucanetd failing to cleanup MidoNet (API call failures). Unresponsive NSDB and high number of flow entries contribute to midolman/OVS in setting up new network flows.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to replicate this problem in a \"sane\"
