Thomas","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"In order to perform this task, CloudWatchFalseDataSystemMetricGenerator.groovy (which can be found in the \"eucalyptus\" module under /devel) had to be modified to take new API changes into account.  Several test runs were performed.  \r\n\r\nEach instance generated 28 data points per minute.  CloudWatchHelper.consolidatePutMetricDataList() was called after data points from a certain number of instances was generated.  (This value varied in the test runs).  \r\n\r\nThe following tests runs were performed:\r\n\r\n1) 10,000 instances worth of data (280,000 data points per minute) were fed into the system for 60 \"minutes\".  Only one instance's data was collected and put through CloudWatchHelper.consolidatePutMetricData() before 'putMetricData' was called.    It took 15-20 minutes to perform all the putMetricData calls at the web service level required to enter 1 \"minute\" of data.  (This does not include post web-service processing time in an internal queue).  After about 12 \"minutes\" of data, db related errors appeared in the log.  The maximum number of data points in the queue was 2781968.  Only 14 \"minutes\" worth of data was able to be put into the system.  Several hours later, the system ran out of heap space.\r\n\r\n2) 10,000 instances worth of data (280,000 data points per minute) were fed into the system for 30 \"minutes\".  50 instances worth of data were collected and put through CloudWatchHelper.consolidatePutMetricData() before 'putMetricData' was called.    It took about 10 minutes to perform all the putMetricData calls at the web service level required to enter 1 \"minute\" of data.  After about 12 \"minutes\" of data, db related errors appeared in the log.  The maximum number of data points in the queue was 2807632.  Only 14 \"minutes\" worth of data was able to be put into the system.  Several hours later, the system ran out of heap space.\r\n\r\nFrom #2 above, it appears calling the CloudWatchHelper.consolidatePutMetricData() may speed up web service processing. \r\n\r\n3) 10,000 instances worth of data (280,000 data points per minute) were fed into the system for 5 \"minutes\".  20 instances worth of data were collected and put through CloudWatchHelper.consolidatePutMetricData() before 'putMetricData' was called.    It took about 10 minutes to perform all the putMetricData calls at the web service level required to enter 1 \"minute\" of data.  No db related errors appeared in the log, but this is probably due to the shorter duration of the run.  The maximum number of data points in the queue was 940998.  After all of the putMetricData calls were completed, it still took about 4 hours to clear out the queue.\r\n\r\nFrom #3 above, it appears 50 vs 20 instances worth of data for CloudWatchHelper.consolidatePutMetricData() does not have much of an effect on the speed of web processing.  This makes sense, as each putMetricData call put at most 20 points into the system. \r\n\r\nIt also appears that 10,000 data points are too many to put into the system at present on a 2 node system. Given that the web service was able to handle 10,000 data points in about 10 minutes, it seemed reasonable to test 1,000 data points.\r\n\r\n4) 1,000 instances worth of data (28,000 data points per minute) were fed into the system for 60 \"minutes\".  Only one instance's data was collected and put through CloudWatchHelper.consolidatePutMetricData() before 'putMetricData' was called.   It took less than two minutes to perform all the putMetricData calls at the web service level required to enter 1 \"minute\" of data.  (But sometimes more than 1 minute).  No db related errors appeared in the log.  The maximum number of data points in the queue was 1087284.  After all of the putMetricData calls were completed, it still took about 4.5 hours to clear out the queue.\r\n\r\nFrom the above, 1,000 data points may be doable in real-time from a web service perspective.  The queue backlog will become an issue, eventually, however.\r\n\r\n5) 5,000 instances worth of data (14,000 data points per minute) were fed into the system for 3 \"hours\".  20 instances worth of data were collected and put through CloudWatchHelper.consolidatePutMetricData() before 'putMetricData' was called.    It took about 40 seconds to perform all the putMetricData calls at the web service level required to enter 1 \"minute\" of data.  No db related errors appeared in the log.  The queue usage did increase over time, however.  The maximum number of data points in the queue was 1353330.  After all of the putMetricData calls were completed, it still took about 7 hours to clear out the queue.\r\n\r\nFrom the above, it appears 500 data points (and possibly 1000, if CloudWatchHelper.consolidatePutMetricData() is more strategically called) are able to be processed into the system, but the queue usage may eventually disallow this scenario.  \r\n\r\nMore tests are currently running to see what happens when 24 hours worth of data is fed into the system.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ethomas","name":"ethomas","key":"ethomas","accountId":"557058:8f092f9a-0724-44c0-84a3-0220705f856a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Evan Thomas","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-12T21:01:35.863-0500","updated":"2015-05-12T21:01:35.863-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/36142/comment/86560","id":"86560","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ethomas","name":"ethomas","key":"ethomas","accountId":"557058:8f092f9a-0724-44c0-84a3-0220705f856a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Evan Thomas","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I also kicked off some tests similar to the previous comment, namely 100, 200, 300, 500, and 1,000 instances (all consolidated every 20 instances) and all with 24 \"hours\" of data and let the test run for 5 days.\r\n\r\nFor the 1,000 instance test (28,000 data points per minute) , database errors started to occur approximately 4 hours into the test, with only 3 \"hours\" worth of data having been put through 'putMetricData'.

The queue leveled off at about 4,300,000 points, and had a few more or less but stayed about that size after 9 hours.\r\n\r\nFor the 500 instance test (14,000 data points per minute) , database errors started to occur approximately 9 hours into the test, with only 7.5 \"hours\" worth of data having been put through 'putMetricData'.  After 5 days, only 14 hours worth of data had gone through putMetricData.  At first, it took about 45 seconds to enter 1 minute of data into 'putMetricData', but after about 7 hours, it started to climb, finally setting on between 12-14 minutes per 'minute' of data.  The queue leveled off at about 4,300,000 points, and had a few more or less but stayed about that size after 14 hours.\r\n\r\nFor the 300 instance test (8,400 data points per minute) , database errors started to occur approximately 21 hours into the test, but the 'putMetricData' call was only 6 minutes behind in real time.  After about 2.5 days, all the data had gone through putMetricData.  At first, it took about 20 seconds to enter 1 minute of data into 'putMetricData', but after about 20 hours, it started to climb, finally setting on between 15-20 minutes per 'minute' of data.  The queue maxed out at 4,429,056 points.  (Stayed around this level starting 24 hours in then started to fall about 2.5 days in (presumably after all the data was put in).  Took 4.5 days (total) to empty the queue.\r\n\r\nFor the 200 instance test (5,600 data points per minute) , no database errors occurred.  It never took more tha 20 seconds to put 1 minute of data into the 'putMetricData' call.  The 'putMetricData' calls all went in in real time.  The queue did manage to grow, however, maxing out at 946,062 points.  Took about 1.5 days (total) to clear out queue.\r\n\r\nFor the 100 instance test (2,800 data points per minute) , no database errors occurred.  It never took more than 15 seconds to put 1 minute of data into the 'putMetricData' call.  The 'putMetricData' calls all went in in real time.  The queue generally stayed at the 2,800 points that went in per minute, but never got larger than 9,000 points.  Queue was clear at the end of 24 hours.\r\n\r\nOne point to note in the above is that the queue is hard coded to deal with no more than 15,000 points per minute.  This was done because if all points were taken, the queue processing would start to take longer than a minute to process, and more items would go into the queue each iteration, and there would be a feedback loop.  There appears to be a feedback loop anyway, so some strategy may be considered there.\r\n\r\nIt appears then that the number of instances that can be safely put into the system end to end is 100.  200 may not break the system, but it does appear to grow the queue.  We would need to run a longer test to see if 200 instances can break the system eventually.  It may require running the test with 72 hours worth of data or so, which I will not do now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ethomas","name":"ethomas","key":"ethomas","accountId":"557058:8f092f9a-0724-44c0-84a3-0220705f856a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Evan Thomas","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-16T14:13:27.329-0500","updated":"2015-05-16T14:13:27.329-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
