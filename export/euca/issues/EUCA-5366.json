I have installed windows 7 image into it. When I try to run the windows 7 instance and access it from client machine(windows xp) I'm able to log on to it. It works very well for hours! Now when I attach a volume using \"euca-attach-volume  vol-BC8B3F3E  i-F79841A6 -d /dev/sde\" it gets attached. I could also see the volume attached from the remote desktop. But after 5 mins the remote desktop connection gets disconneted. Then even if I try to remote desktop to that instance it does not get connected. Still the status of instance is running and volume is attached.\r\n\r\nThen I executed \"netstat -tulpn | grep kvm\" command on NC and got the port number of the running instance. Then I used the VNC viewer from the windows xp machine to logon to the running instance. I used<ip-of-NC>:<port-no-of-instance> to logon to it it. It showed up that its connecting but then it simply blinked and then nothing happened. Tried it from different XP machines with VNC viewer, still the same result. Then I used a machine running CentOS 6.3 and from that using \"Remote Desktop Viewer\" I did the same thing ie. used<ip-of-NC>:<port-no-of-instance> and I was surprised to see that it opened up. I was able to log on to that instance from this machine. I could also see the volune attached to it. Worked very well. But now I'm not able to understancd why it did not open from VNC Viewer in windows XP? And why is the connection getting disconnected when I'm using RDP from windows XP or windows 7 machine? Is there any settings in windows OS to be configured so as to make it alive all time?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor your reference here are the links of a video showing the error, cc.log,nc.log and libvirt.xsl:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/xc1dgwlzw7ilzz0/video-2013-03-05-17-00-13.mp4\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/v3niacwzc0ath0r/new_cc.log\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6m1km7ksep80mnf/new_nc.log\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/sbngmkxsp0epegh/libvirt.xsl\r\n\r\nPlz help me in this issue.\r\n\r\nThanking you in anticipation,\r\nRegards,\r\nRadhakrishnan","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-16","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Unable to remote desktop to windows 7 instance after volume attachment","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=rk","name":"rk","key":"rk","accountId":"557058:c361950b-7c53-47bd-a5fc-6ae94b148aea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a492cc38d3ff8072ce8cad3c4db9d1ac?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a492cc38d3ff8072ce8cad3c4db9d1ac?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a492cc38d3ff8072ce8cad3c4db9d1ac?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a492cc38d3ff8072ce8cad3c4db9d1ac?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Radhakrishnan S.

Iyer","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Ok.. Now, I would like to address this issue.\nAs we have discussed, after volume attachment, the remote desktop connection just dies. This is an after effect of what I feel a problem in eucalyptus itself, not the Microsoft's remote desktop connection. Following are my reasons for the same.\n\n1. When we connect remotely via Microsoft's remote desktop viewer, we entered the \"public IP\" of the virtual instance. After attachment, the connection died and we were helpless. This is because \"public IP\" of instance is \"lost\" after volume attachment.\n\n2. TigerVNC worked well because we were giving the \"IP_address_of_NC\":\"port_of_a_running_virtual_image\" for example,\n10.3.7.150:5900\n10.3.7.150 being our NC and 5900 is the port we got by running netstat command.\nBUT, when we tried \"public IP\" of the virtual machine in the TigerVNC after volume attachment, \"result is still the same!\" No connection. So TigerVNC works for the time being because we are at least able to run the image after volume attachment although in a small window size with no support for scaling in full screen mode. Microsoft's Remote desktop failed because it could not connect to a virtual machine if we give 10.3.7.150:5900 kind of address.\n\n3. Nevertheless, we tried our luck with Chrome's RDP:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-rdp/cbkkbcmdlboombapidmoeolnmdacpkch?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon\nIt turns out that Google also provides a Remote desktop application for connecting to Microsoft images.\nResult the same! We tried connecting without volume attachment, worked like a charm. But when we attached volume, after exactly 7 minutes(yep.. we counted it..) the connection died and we were no longer to connect to that instance. Interestingly, the instance was still accessible via TigerVNC using 10.3.7.150:5900.\n\nSo.. to sum it up, I believe on attaching the volumes, the service in eucalyptus that is responsible for providing public IPs to instances dies and the only way left to access them is via the port number on NC's Ip address(which fortunately is still active :D). because Google is charging $10 on that software of theirs' and I fail to believe that they would let it out without proper testing and moreover same issue replicated in Microsoft's app and also TigerVNC.\n\nSo as I am saying, if it is correct, how to restart that particular service so that we can have those instances get their public IPs? Can you please look into that and let us know?\n\nThanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=rk","name":"rk","key":"rk","accountId":"557058:c361950b-7c53-47bd-a5fc-6ae94b148aea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a492cc38d3ff8072ce8cad3c4db9d1ac?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a492cc38d3ff8072ce8cad3c4db9d1ac?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a492cc38d3ff8072ce8cad3c4db9d1ac?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a492cc38d3ff8072ce8cad3c4db9d1ac?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Radhakrishnan S.
