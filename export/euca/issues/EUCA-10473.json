For example, to call 'SendMessageBatch' you need permission for 'sqs:SendMessage'\r\n2) ListQueues requires a resource of \"*\" in a policy.  Anything else will deny access\r\n3) GetQueueUrl will return a 400 instead of a 403 status code if permission does not exist.\r\n4) ListDeadLetterSourceQueues only needs permission on the queue you pass in. It may list any queue in the account.\r\n5) We support \"verbose\" for ListQueues called by an administator.\r\n\r\nTests include\r\n1) Performing \"AddPermission\" with a user with and without \"sqs:AddPermission\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource passed in as queue url).  Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:AddPermission\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n2) Performing \"ChangeMessageVisibility\" with a user with and without \"sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource passed in as queue url).  Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n3) Performing \"ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch\" with a user with and without \"sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource passed in as queue url). Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n4) Performing \"CreateQueue\" with a user with and without \"sqs:CreateQueue\" permission.  (wildcard resource only).\r\n5) Performing \"DeleteMessage\" with a user with and without \"sqs:DeleteMessage\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource passed in as queue url). Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:DeleteMessage\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n6) Performing \"DeleteMessageBatch\" with a user with and without \"sqs:DeleteMessage\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource passed in as queue url). Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:DeleteMessage\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n7) Performing \"DeleteQueue\" with a user with and without \"sqs:DeleteQueue\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource passed in as queue url). Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:DeleteQueue\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n8) Performing \"GetQueueAttributes\" with a user with and without \"sqs:GetQueueAttributes\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource passed in as queue url). Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:GetQueueAttributes\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n9) Performing \"GetQueueUrl\" with a user with and without \"sqs:GetQueueUrl\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource based on the queue name passed in). Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:GetQueueUrl\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).  QueueDoesNotExist should be returned where AccessDenied would normally be returned.\r\n10) Performing \"ListDeadLetterSourceQueues\" with a user with and without \"sqs:ListDeadLetterSourceQueues\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource passed in as queue url). Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:ListDeadLetterSourceQueues\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n11) Performing \"ListQueues\" with a user with and without \"sqs:ListQueues\" permission.

Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:PurgeQueue\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n13) Performing \"ReceiveMessage\" with a user with and without \"sqs:ReceiveMessage\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource passed in as queue url). Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:ReceiveMessage\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n14) Performing \"RemovePermission\" with a user with and without \"sqs:RemovePermission\" permission.  (wildcard or just the queue arn resource passed in as queue url). Also try a user in another account with \"sqs:RemovePermission\" (should fail) and try as system admin (should succeed).\r\n15) Performing \"SendMessage\" with a user with and without \"sqs:SendMessage\" permission.
