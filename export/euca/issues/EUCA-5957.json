This tool would be similar to the [AWS Diagnostics for Microsoft Windows Server tool|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Windows-Server-Diagnostics.html].\r\n\r\n*Brief Description*\r\n\r\n_AWS Diagnostics for Microsoft Windows Server_ is a simple and easy to use tool that can be run on an Amazon EC2 Windows Server instance to diagnose and troubleshoot possible issues. It is a very valuable tool not just for collecting log files and troubleshooting issues, but also proactively searching for possible areas of concern. This tool can, for example, be used to diagnose configuration issues between the Windows Firewall and the AWS security groups that may affect your applications. It can even examine EBS boot volumes from other instances and collect relevant logs for troubleshooting Windows Server instances on that volume.\r\n\r\nAWS Diagnostics for Microsoft Windows Server provides the following analysis rules:\r\n\r\n* Check for activation status and KMS settings\r\n* Check for proper route table entries for meta data and KMS access\r\n* Comparison of Amazon EC2 security group rules against Windows Firewall rules\r\n* Check the version of the PV driver (Redhat or Citrix)\r\n* Check if the _RealTimeIsUniversal_ registry key is set\r\n* Check the default gateway settings if using multiple NICs\r\n* Bug check code in mini dump files\r\n\r\n\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-24","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/attachment/15529","id":"15529","filename":"error.png","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra
