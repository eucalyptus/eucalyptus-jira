(It is not clear how the script could return non-zero and what was the cause of it, but at any rate the deadlock was clearly a bug under those circumstances.)\n\nThis problem was noticed by static code analysis tool Coverity and is already fixed in the 3.2 code branch.\n\n*QA notes:* To test the fix, one should install an NC hook (an executable shell script or whatnot into {{$EUCALYPTUS/etc/eucalyptus/nc-hooks}} directory, similar to the {{example.sh}} that is already there) that would return non-zero status only for the {{nc-event-pre-hyp-check}} event.
