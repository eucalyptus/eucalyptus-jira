Subsequent requests using this upload ID (to upload part or abort the upload) fail to authenticate in the OSG. According to Zach Hill, this is because the upload ID is not url encoded by the client (aws sdk) there by causing a mismatch in the signatures computed by the client and the OSG. This is mainly seen with RiakCS backend since the upload IDs contains characters that need to be URL encoded (such as '='). It should be easy to reproduce this failure outside of the SC by using the aws sdk directly against OSG and RiakCS backend, I'll work with the storage team to fix this.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/attachment/19164","id":"19164","filename":"clc_logs.tar.gz","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=shaon","name":"shaon","key":"shaon","accountId":"557058:1e5e1aa5-5986-4a9e-b9ed-814f7000cd4f","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Imran Hossain Shaon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-13T09:33:22.959-0500","size":3497900,"mimeType":"application/x-gzip","content":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/secure/attachment/19164/clc_logs.tar.gz"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Subsequent requests using this upload ID fail to authenticate in the OSG","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=shaon","name":"shaon","key":"shaon","accountId":"557058:1e5e1aa5-5986-4a9e-b9ed-814f7000cd4f","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Imran Hossain Shaon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=shaon","name":"shaon","key":"shaon","accountId":"557058:1e5e1aa5-5986-4a9e-b9ed-814f7000cd4f","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/70d1c1681d03ea38518d3b4f59db4385?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dshaon%26avatarId%3D11900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Imran Hossain Shaon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12100":"0|i02kzr:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"10000_*:*_1_*:*_15877994_*|*_6_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["shaon(shaon)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-8896/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
