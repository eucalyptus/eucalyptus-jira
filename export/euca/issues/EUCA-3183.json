They do not attempt to delete other loopbacks.  I'm not even sure that there is a clear way for Red Hat to do that.  \n\nMy feeling is that there are two possibilities\n\na) the storage controller services from eucalyptus-cloud delete all of the tgtd associations and then delete the loopbacks during shutdown\n\nb) a new script is added before K05eucalyptus-cloud and before K75netfs which does something like \n\n{code}\nfor i in `losetup --all | grep /var/lib/eucalyptus/volumes  | sed 's/:.*//'`; do losetup -d $i; done`\n{code}\n\n\na) sort of seems like a right thing to do but\nb) is safer since it will also delete loopbacks which get forgotten about due to application inconsistency etc.  \n\nIt might even be a good idea to do both.  \n\n\nN.B. With the shutdown running all night, only about 11 of 100 loopbacks have been processed;  This likely means that shutting down a system will take about a week :-) ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mdlr","name":"mdlr","key":"mdlr","accountId":"557058:29fd1eba-b820-4c8d-9228-0f52cb260d76","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/15f3c4b7a0cf758ddb400a37f09f0c86?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/15f3c4b7a0cf758ddb400a37f09f0c86?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/15f3c4b7a0cf758ddb400a37f09f0c86?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/15f3c4b7a0cf758ddb400a37f09f0c86?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael De La Rue","active":false,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2012-08-03T03:23:19.197-0500","updated":"2012-08-03T03:23:19.197-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/15028/comment/30558","id":"30558","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Tweaked description.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2012-08-03T11:41:35.606-0500","updated":"2012-08-03T11:41:35.606-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/15028/comment/31121","id":"31121","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yes, this is an issue.
