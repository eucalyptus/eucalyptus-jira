While EUCA-13168 handled the issue if update stack timed out, it would not have fixed the issue if we timed out in a later portion of the update workflow, such as update cleanup, update rollback, or update rollback cleanup.  (For that matter, we did not handle timeout during delete or rollback either).\r\n\r\nHence the first thing that was done was to treat all workflows uniformly.  We created a rollback workflow, which took the logic of actually rolling back (or deleting) out of the MonitorCreateStackWorkflow, which now just monitored the stack during create, noticed if the create workflow was closed and either just set the status to create failed, kicked off rollback, or kicked off delete accordingly.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, we have Monitor*Workflows for each of Create, Delete, Rollback, Update, UpdateCleanup, UpdateRollback, UpdateRollbackCleanup, each with a slightly longer timeout than the underlying workflow they are monitoring, so that no portion of the stack lifecycle is vulnerable to not being dealt with during timeout or cancellation of workflow.\r\n\r\nFurther, we relaxed the restriction about not allowing stacks to be deleted if it is in an UPDATE_*_IN_PROGRESS.  We can delete a stack in this condition if all workflows associated with the stack are closed, this allows fixing the situation if monitoring workflows have timed out, for example.\r\n\r\nFinally, I created two utility methods in a class called StackAdminUtils.java that can allow an administrator to deal with some stuck stacks in a last ditch effort,\r\n\r\nStackAdminUtils.cancelWorkflows(<stackId>) will cancel all workflows for a stack, which could also be done with SWF tools, but it is not a simple task, as we would need SWF compatible tools and access to credentials for the cloudformation system account.\r\n\r\nStackAdminUtils.removeStack(<stackId>) will remove all metadata about the stack, essentially deleting it immediately though leaving the resources behind.\r\n\r\nInvocation of the above is done via the euca config property such as\r\n{code}\r\neuctl euca='com.eucalyptus.cloudformation.StackAdminUtils.cancelWorkflows(\"arn:aws:cloudformation::000045884868:stack/mystack/633727db-ef49-4952-9d02-07846c84bd49\")'\r\n{code}\r\nor\r\n\r\n{code}\r\neuctl euca='com.eucalyptus.cloudformation.StackAdminUtils.deletelWorkflows(\"arn:aws:cloudformation::000045884868:stack/mystack/633727db-ef49-4952-9d02-07846c84bd49\")'\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote.  I don't know if we document euca properties, does this need a doc ticket?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ethomas","name":"ethomas","key":"ethomas","accountId":"557058:8f092f9a-0724-44c0-84a3-0220705f856a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Evan Thomas","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-04-24T12:23:06.570-0500","updated":"2017-04-24T12:24:16.320-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/57303/comment/121038","id":"121038","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~ethomas], looks good to me. We would not document use of the StackAdminUtils methods. I noted the following while reviewing:\r\n\r\nMore important:\r\n* StackAdminUtils should call shutdown on AmazonSimpleWorkflow when done\r\n* StackEntityManager#getNonDeletedStackById should not use deprecated Entities#createCriteria\r\n* CommonDeleteRollbackPromises references CreateStackWorkflowImpl.LOG\r\n* DeleteStackWorkflowImpl#performDeleteStack return type is Promise<String> but CommonDeleteRollbackPromises#getPromise returns Promise<?>\r\n\r\nLess important:\r\n* StackEventHelper overly verbose logging? LOG.info(\"Done creating global stack event:...\r\n* MonitorDeleteStackWorkflowDescriptionTemplate description is \"MonitorRollbackStackWorkflow\"\r\n* MonitorUpdateCleanupStackWorkflowDescriptionTemplate description is \"UpdateCleanupStackWorkflow\"\r\n* MonitorUpdateRollbackCleanupStackWorkflowDescriptionTemplate description is \"UpdateCleanupStackWorkflow\"\r\n* MonitorUpdateRollbackStackWorkflowDescriptionTemplate description is \"UpdateCleanupStackWorkflow\"\r\n* All new code should have current license header, e.g. MonitorDeleteStackWorkflowDescriptionTemplate\r\n\r\nThis is more of a style comment, but I would put metadata (e.g. #isUpdateWorkflow()) in the StackWorkflowEntity.WorkflowType enum and then generate EnumSets at runtime rather than checking against lots of workflow types (e.g. in CloudFormationService#deleteStack). This helps with maintainability as it is clear that you have to think about that aspect of a new workflow type when adding it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-04-24T16:14:43.824-0500","updated":"2017-04-24T16:14:43.824-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-13344/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
