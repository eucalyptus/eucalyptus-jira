This issue became apparent while working with the Eucalyptus Community Cloud (ECC).\r\n\r\nThe environments into which Eucalyptus is deployed may vary in their willingness or ability to support password recovery. The description below is based only on the ECC case.\r\n\r\nScenario: User attempts to log into the User Console. After a couple of failed attempts the user discovers that he's forgotten his password. He clicks a \"Forgot Password\" link, enters his account and user name. The user is informed that an email will arrive with a link to enable him to login. The email arrives, the user clicks a link which opens a page in the browser in which the user must enter a new password. The user sets the new password and then shown the dashboard.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n  * The password request and associated change should be logged as this isn't a \"normal\" path for users.\r\n  * It is acceptable for the solution to generate a new password, which the user uses to login once and is immediately required to change the password.\r\n  * It is assumed that not all customers can support this model. Therefore the cloud administrator (or IT admin) must be able to enable / disable this feature.\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Support \"forgot password\" capability in User Console","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucacolby","name":"eucacolby","key":"eucacolby","accountId":"557058:2399a28c-111f-487f-a7c3-c97d4afe7520","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Colby Dyess","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucacolby","name":"eucacolby","key":"eucacolby","accountId":"557058:2399a28c-111f-487f-a7c3-c97d4afe7520","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3dcd7403e3ff9c58e4700d1932f12ca3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Colby Dyess","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i0257j:","customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_124679718033","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_11600":["eucacolby(eucacolby)"],"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-6844/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
