Mysore","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"From [~hspencer] -\n\nWhen we say \"cloud-init equivalent\", what do we mean here?  Do we mean something that will pull a file or whatever is passed via user-data, and execute it as a script?  Or are we saying support all the formats that cloud-init supports? Currently, the support by EC2Config is the following:\n\nUser Data\n\nUser data execution enables you to inject scripts into the instance metadata during the first launch. From an instance, you can read user data at http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/. This information remains static for the life of the instance, persisting when the instance is stopped and started, until it is terminated.\n\nIf you use a large script, we recommend that you use user data to download the script, and then execute it.\n\nFor EC2Config to execute user data, you must enclose the lines of the script within one of the following special tags:\n\n<script></script>\nRun any command that you can run at the cmd.exe prompt.\n\nExample: <script>dir > c:\\test.log</script>\n\n<powershell></powershell>\nRun any command that you can run at the Windows PowerShell prompt.\n\nIf you use an AMI that includes the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, you can also use those cmdlets. If you specify an IAM role when you launch your instance, then you don't need to specify credentials to the cmdlets, as applications that run on the instance can use the role's credentials to access AWS resources such as Amazon S3 buckets.\n\nExample: <powershell>Read-S3Object -BucketName myS3Bucket -Key myFolder/myFile.zip -File c:\\destinationFile.zip</powershell>\n\nIf both script and powershell tags are present, the batch script is executed first, and then the PowerShell script, regardless of the order in which they appear.\n\nEC2Config expects the user data to be available in base64 encoding. If the user data is not available in base64 encoding, EC2Config logs an error about being unable to find script or powershell tags to execute. If your encoding is not correct, the following is an example that sets the encoding using PowerShell.\n\n$UserData = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes($Script))\n\nInitial Boot\n\nBy default, all Amazon AMIs have user data execution enabled for the initial boot. If you click Shutdown with Sysprep in EC2Config, user data execution is re-enabled, regardless of the setting of the User Data check box.\n\nUser data execution happens under the local administrator user only when a random password is generated. This is because EC2Config generates the password and is aware of the credentials briefly (prior to sending to the console). EC2Config doesn't store or track password changes, so when you don't generate a random password, user data execution is performed by the EC2Config service account.\n\nSubsequent Boots\n\nBecause the user data plug-in automatically disables after initial boot, you must do one of the following to persist user data across reboots:\n\n• Programmatically create a scheduled task to run at system start using schtasks.exe /Create, and point the scheduled task to the user data script (or another script) at C:\\Program Files\\Amazon\\Ec2ConfigServer\\Scripts\\UserScript.ps1.\n\n• Programmatically re-enable the user data plug-in in Settings.xml using a script similar to the following.\n\n<powershell>\n$EC2SettingsFile=\"C:\\Program Files\\Amazon\\Ec2ConfigService\\Settings\\Config.xml\"\n$xml = [xml](get-content $EC2SettingsFile)\n$xmlElement = $xml.get_DocumentElement()\n$xmlElementToModify = $xmlElement.Plugins\n\nforeach ($element in $xmlElementToModify.Plugin)\n{\n    if ($element.name -eq \"Ec2SetPassword\")\n    {\n        $element.State=\"Enabled\"\n    }\n    elseif ($element.name -eq \"Ec2HandleUserData\")\n    {\n        $element.State=\"Enabled\"\n    }\n}\n$xml.Save($EC2SettingsFile)\n</powershell>\n\n• Starting with EC2Config version 2.1.10, you can use <persist>true</persist> to re-enable the plug-in after user data execution.\n\n=======\nRegarding AD, here are the PowerShell modules - http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee617195.aspx.

Here is what EC2Config does: \n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html\n\nRegarding hostname, here is what EC2Config can do: \n\nSet Computer Name\nSets the hostname of the instance to a unique name based on the IP address of the instance and reboots one time after booting. To set your own hostname, or to prevent your existing hostname from being modified, don't enable this setting. \n\n^ This is part of the EC2Config service, nothing to do with using user-data.\n\nUsing user-data to do these things is fine but, imo, not the primary way to do it.  We should be doing it via the tool, not asking users to write their own powershell snippets *just* to set hostname and AD (which is what will happen).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=shashi","name":"shashi","key":"shashi","accountId":"557058:cc7ee5dc-1d4f-46c5-8068-6ae350275ba6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Shashi Mysore","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-28T19:16:14.706-0500","updated":"2013-06-28T19:16:14.706-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/21909/comment/49082","id":"49082","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~hspencer][~shashi][~lwade] thanks for the feedback. here's what i think on the questions:\r\n\r\n-- cloud-init in windows vm: we not only need the capability to execute the shell script (like ec2-config does), but also needs the capability to pass in a manifest (zipped file with script, exe, dll, any resource files) and execute inside the vm. the primary use-case is the QA where we will update the tool without reinstalling the windows. this will be crucial for customer upgrade as well because we shouldn't ask them to rebundle instances for any new windows tool update. for passing shell scripts via user-data, we can follow the same ec2-config convention. \r\n\r\n-- setting parameters through user-data: one significant pain with the current tool is that people have to re-bundle instances or images when they change parameters (such as hostname, AD config, etc) via the tool. this story does not ask users to execute their shell script for parameter changes. Rather, we will define a format (json or xml) where people can use to specify windows-tool parameters which will override the parameters baked in the image. \r\n\r\nIn summary, the cloud-init capability will includes the capabilities\r\n1) to execute arbitrary script\r\n2) to pass-in windows-tool parameters\r\n3) to pass-in manifest (executable + resource files)\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-28T20:26:21.954-0500","updated":"2013-06-28T20:27:16.693-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/21909/comment/49083","id":"49083","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Would it make sense to at least support the options that EC2Config service provides, as well as the capabilities you mentioned?
