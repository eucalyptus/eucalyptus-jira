We need to rename the property or create a new one that is more descriptive to enable that mode, but with some testing and minor fixes we should be able to support EBS without any Walrus uploads.\n\nThe limitations/requirements:\n1. ALL clusters must be backed by the same SAN device such that all clusters (SCs) can see the same set of snapshots and volumes on the SAN itself. If this is not true then trying to create a volume from a snapshot in a cluster other than the cluster that the snapshot originated from will fail (volume creation will result in 'failed' volume).\n\n2. If the walrus-less EBS mode is turned OFF (uploads re-enabled) in the future, then all snapshots created when that mode was active will not be available on any *new* clusters added that do *not* have access to the same SAN that the snapshots were originally created on.\n\nWe are testing and investigating this for full use as a feature, but the work looks very tractable and feasible.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-18T21:35:08.202-0500","updated":"2013-06-18T21:35:08.202-0500"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-5434/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
