Signature V4 was prototyped and tested using the AWS SDK v1.3.22.\n\nNo V4 specific issues were found during implementation, though there are some ambiguities.\n\nThe only severe issue found during evaluation of signatures is that the AWS SDK does not use the right path when calculating signatures (always uses \"/\"). This area of the SDK implementation is somewhat confusing as there is both an endpoint and a resource path. The resource path is used for things like keys in S3, there is no such distinction in the signature specifications:\n\n{quote}\nThis is the URI-encoded version of the absolute path component of the URI—everything from the HTTP host header to the question mark character \n{quote}\n\n  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-create-canonical-request.html\n\nAmbiguities:\n\n# What should we use for the service name (e.g. \"iam\")\n# Would we require a particular region?\n\n\n\n2) Evaluate and report on changes needed to the current version of the AWS Java SDK to point it at a Eucalyptus install.\n\nUsing the Java SDK with Eucalyptus requires setting the endpoint for each client, for example with EC2:\n\n{code}\nAmazonEC2 ec2 = new AmazonEC2Client( credentials );\nec2.setEndpoint( \"http://example.eucalyptus.com:8773/services/Eucalyptus/\" )\n{code}\n\nTo use an HTTPS endpoint, services would either need to use a recognized certificate or the Java VM would need to be configured for trust of the automatically generated certificate.\n\n\n\n3) Evaluate and report on other obstacles to using AWS Java SDK after the above changes are made.\n\nIn the available time it was not possible to broadly exercise the APIs. Tests covered:\n\n * EC2 - All Describe* actions; Run instance; Add/delete security group.\n * IAM - All List* actions; Add/delete group.\n * STS - Issue session token\n * S3 - Add/delete bucket, object (upload/download), object version; Read/write bucket ACL, logging configuration, \n\nThe only issues uncovered by testing are the above signature issue and a general Walrus issue with \"Last-Modified\" dates (EUCA-3978).\n\nA minor issue is that it is not possible to set the endpoint when using the \"STSSessionCredentialsProvider\".\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-10-29T15:55:17.706-0500","updated":"2012-10-29T15:55:17.706-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/16743/comment/36829","id":"36829","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"AWS feedback on the signature issue:\n\n{quote}\nIt sounds like the AWS4Signer isn't taking into account that the endpoint might have some component of the resource path on it. This isn't something that we currently support in the SDK since none of the AWS services use resource paths in any endpoints, but from the perspective of correctness, it seems like something that'd be nice to have. Since the AWS services don't use this construct, we probably won't jump on this one immediately, but if that's blocking you, it'd probably be easy to fork the AWS SDK for Java repo on GitHub and add a customization. If it's a clean fix, then of course we'd be happy to look at a pull request back into the main repository, too. \n{quote}\n\nFrom https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=405687\n\nPull

It looks like S3 signatures have a similar path issue to the one found for Signature V4, i.e. the endpoint component of the path is ignored:\n\n  /services/Walrus/awssdk-bucket-test8/ # request path\n  /awssdk-bucket-test8/                 # AWS SDK calculated path\n\nI did not include this issue in the initial report for this spike. This issue means that you cannot use S3 with the AWS Java SDK (v1.3.26 tested)\n\nIt is easy enough to implement a special case for this in the signature check should we want to do so (to allow these invalid signatures)\n\nAnother issue is that you cannot configure which naming scheme to use for S3. If you configure an IP address it will work, but if you use a hostname then the SDK will attempt to use bucket specific hosts. An example for the above bucket would be:\n\n  awssdk-bucket-test8.myeucaserver.mydomain.com\n\nIt is possible to extend the AmazonS3Client to get the desired (path-style) request with hostnames as well as IP addresses.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-14T13:13:52.292-0600","updated":"2013-01-14T13:13:52.292-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/16743/comment/38816","id":"38816","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The original github pull request has been updated to address path issues with v3 and S3 signatures [1], this fix will allow the AWS Java SDK to access Walrus (thanks to [~dshekhawat] for the S3 patch)\n\nI also opened another pull request to allow the user to select path-style access [2] for all requests [3].
