preferable.\r\n\r\nThe IP used to register components should be the internal IP and there should be a cloud property (or properties) that define the interfaces that web services should listen on (this configuration is already possible for DNS). The web services framework would listen on the \"--bind-addr\" for internal use (on port 8773) and later in the bootstrap process when cloud properties are available a public listener would be started on an IP matching the public interface (cidr?)\r\n\r\nHost.getHostAddresses (or similar) could be used to map registered services from their internal IP (Host.getBindAddress) to the appropriate public IP and this would be used with both external DNS requests (split horizon) and eucarc service URLs.\r\n\r\nJGroups would not need to be updated and DNS already supports configuration of the interface(s) to listen on.

Configurable port and bind addresses for DNS and Web Services \r\nDNS and Web Services will initially start up listeners on the bind address (--bind-addr) and default ports (53, 8773) only. When  configuration from the database is available later in the start up process listeners will be started on the configured addresses and ports in addition to the initial listeners.\r\n\r\nThe default configuration will be for the web services listener to listen on all addresses (0.0.0.0) on port 8773 and DNS on the detected or configured bind address on port 53.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n{code}\r\n  dns.dns_listener_address_match = 10.111.0.0/16\r\n  bootstrap.webservices.listener_address_match = 10.111.0.0/16\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4. DNS host mappings\r\nThe DNS service will be updated to support mapping of registered host addresses to addresses on alternative host interfaces by CIDR. A cloud property would allow a  list of mappings to be defined, each mapping would consist of:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n  CIDR(listener match) -> CIDR(host match)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe cluster already knows the available addresses for each host so this is sufficient information to allow mapping to be performed on any host.\r\n\r\nThis (for example) supports mapping for both \"public\" and \"management\" interfaces.\r\n\r\nBy default no mappings would be configured and the registered host IPs would be returned.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n{code}\r\n  dns.services.hostmapping = 172.16.55.0/24 -> 10.111.0.0/16\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4. Eucarc host mappings\r\nA cloud configuration property will be added allowing a host match CIDR to be specified for use when mapping host IPs.\r\n\r\nBy default no mapping would be performed and registered host addresses would be returned (when not using DNS)\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n{code}\r\n  authentication.credential_download_host_match\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nMy preference is to not implement this and instead use DNS names in eucarc when necessary.  \r\n\r\nh4. Postgres\r\nThe postgres database service will be updated to listen only on the bind address (--bind-addr) by default. We should add another property to allow postgres to be configured specifically should this be necessary.\r\n\r\nh4. Other services\r\nThe HTTP service and cluster services (membership, caching, etc) would not be modified.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-21T16:44:02.049-0500","updated":"2014-04-21T16:44:02.049-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/28902/comment/67776","id":"67776","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Hi [~sjones],\r\n\r\nYour proposal looks really good to me.
