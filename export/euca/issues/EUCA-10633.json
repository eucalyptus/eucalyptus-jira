the demos we are trying to migrate a running instance on AWS EC2 to Eucalyptus Cloud. We found that we weren't able to launch an instance from the migrated image on Eucalyptus as it fails to boot on the NC complaining:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n2015-03-10 22:46:32 ERROR 000031828 disk_expander            | [i-11d75df0] expected two partitions in EMI (boot and root), but found 0\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe migration process works like this:\r\n\r\na) We boot an instance from Amazon Linux AMI on EC2. For this ticket please refer to following AMI on AWS.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\namzn-ami-hvm-2014.09.2.x86_64-ebs (ami-146e2a7c)\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe AMI is an HVM EBS image.\r\n\r\nb) After the instance is up and running we SSH to it and install euca2ools from source code. Once euca2ools is installed, we copy our Eucalyptus cloud credential to this EC2 instance. Inside the instance we run {{euca-bundle-vol}} like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.githubusercontent.com/jeevanullas/fe19a06f96e98b0bf95b/raw/4c84fb9d9b609fc61df701adea8a277483444841/euca-bundle-vol\r\n\r\nc) After the manifest and bundle parts are ready we copy these to our on-premise infrastructure. We also copy the kernel and ramdisk used with the EC2 instance those were:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nvmlinuz-3.14.27-25.47.amzn1.x86_64 \r\ninitramfs-3.14.27-25.47.amzn1.x86_64.img\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nd) On the Eucalyptus side we now bundle/upload and register the kernel and ramdisk we got from the EC2 instance. Finally when that is done we upload the bundle (from euca-bundle-vol) to Eucalyptus cloud. Finally we register a paravirtual image.\r\n\r\ne) We run an instance from this paravirtual image and this kicks off imaging worker which then converts the image to HVM. The debug logs from imaging worker are seen below:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.githubusercontent.com/jeevanullas/611c8c51dd55dac0862b/raw/66407307dfecb5325718e88282528c36e55b73b1/imaging-worker-euca\r\n\r\nf) Once the imaging worker successfully complete the conversion process the instance tries to boot on the NC. But the instance boot fails as can be seen in the log below:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.githubusercontent.com/jeevanullas/d16ce42f875f4fd9c74c/raw/ebf92fb3d95c07b4dafe3bf268aa4f03ff53306c/nc.log\r\n\r\ng) Unfortunately the imaging worker appears to have successfully converted the image to HVM but Node controller does not have partition information?\r\n\r\nh) We tried to mount the {{blocks}} file in NC cache and found the following:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n# kpartx -a blocks\r\n/dev/mapper/loop6p1\r\n/dev/mapper/loop6p2\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe could loopback mount {{/dev/mapper/loop6p2}} and see the following content:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\neuca-initrd  euca-vmlinuz  grub\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nBut we couldn't mount {{/dev/mapper/loop6p1}} , we could however do this for other images via the same method. Not sure what went wrong with the conversion.\r\n\r\ni) Following is the disk information inside the EC2 instance:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nfdisk -l\r\nWARNING: fdisk GPT support is currently new, and therefore in an experimental phase. Use at your own discretion.\r\n\r\nDisk /dev/xvda: 8589 MB, 8589934592 bytes, 16777216 sectors\r\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\r\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\r\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\r\nDisk label type: gpt\r\n\r\n\r\n#         Start          End    Size  Type            Name\r\n 1         4096     16777182      8G  Linux filesyste Linux\r\n128         2048         4095      1M  BIOS boot parti BIOS Boot Partition\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe migrated with the same process another EC2 instance running from Ubuntu 14.04 AMI to Eucalyptus and that worked just fine. Problem seems to be happening with Amazon Linux AMI.\r\n\r\nIf imaging worker successfully converts the image to HVM why is the NC not able to boot the image ?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDeependra","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"expected two partitions in EMI boot and root but found 0","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":null,"customfield_12100":"0|i035dr:","customfield_10001":"2015-03-12T17:52:53.573-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["dshekhawat(dshekhawat)","dmitrii(dmitrii)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/35221/comment/84128","id":"84128","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hey, [~dshekhawat]. Do you still have access to a system with such an image registered? I'd be curious about the output of the following command (just using {{parted}} to read the partition table instead of the {{kpartx}} that you've tried):\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nparted /path/to/device/with/blocks unit s print\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nIt's the output of that command that NC tries parsing, looking for two partitions. I am not sure why it's not working in this case.\r\n\r\nBut...\r\n\r\nI suspect I know what the problem is. (And even if we fix the partition-counting logic above, the image would simply fail to boot when it got handed over to the hypervisor.) I am guessing that the Amazon Linux AMI is the only HVM image that you're trying to carry over. Ubuntu 14.04 AMI must be paravirt, is it not?\r\n\r\nWhen {{euca-bundle-vol}} runs inside an HVM instance, which has multiple partitions, it tries to preserve the partitions in the image that it produces. So, at the end you don't get a partition, but rather a disk, with a partition table up front. Currently, that's not something that paravirt->HVM conversion logic can grok. It isn't even smart enough to detect that what it's getting (a disk) is not what it expects (a partition). So, it slaps another boot partition and another boot record and calls it converted. The root partition in this converted image contains a disk and thus is not mountable.\r\n\r\nI am trying to think what to suggest here. The intention was to enable this use case (a disk-based PV image) with an ami directive (as described in EUCA-8822), but I am not sure it was fully implemented.

I think I figured what is going wrong here. The reason this did not work is because of me specifying the partition type as {{gpt}} while running {{euca-bundle-vol}}. If I specify the same as {{none}} explicitly and then copy over the kernel, ramdisk and the root filesystem (euca-bundle-vol now gives me a proper ext3/ext4/xfs based filesystem) to the Eucalyptus cloud , Imaging worker is able to convert this registered paravirtual image into an HVM instance.\r\n\r\nI have not tested with {{xfs}} based filesystem but I would be really happy to see if imaging worker does not have any trouble handling the same. It would be very useful as all CentOS 7 and some Fedora AMIs are using default {{xfs}}\r\n\r\nWe can safely close this ticket unless you still feel there is scope of improvement. Please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDeependra","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-06-18T00:37:51.212-0500","updated":"2015-06-18T00:37:51.212-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/35221/comment/88404","id":"88404","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I can confirm that xfs works with the imaging worker just fine.
