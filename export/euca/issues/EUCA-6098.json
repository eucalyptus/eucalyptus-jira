Check if the bucket requested by the user exists.\r\n2. Create the bucket if it doesn't.\r\n3. Bundle the image.\r\n4. Upload the bundle.\r\n5. Delete the bucket if any of those steps failed and we created the bucket in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe NC uses a special code path in euca2ools with a custom authentication scheme to do all of these, but it shouldn't actually need to use them for _any_ of those steps.  The CLC controlling the bundling process should take responsibility for ensuring that the requested bucket is usable, and the NC should use the POST security policy provided by the user to do all of its uploading.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how that might work:\r\n\r\n1. Before it responds to the user's request, the CLC ensures that the requested bucket exists and is accessible.\r\n2. The NC runs euca-bundle-image with its own keys.\r\n3. The NC uploads the bundle to walrus using the POST security policy provided by the user.  It can even use curl for this.\r\n4. If the bundle process fails, the CLC takes care of deleting the bucket if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn 3.4 I was going to move as much of the NC-specifics out of euca2ools and into the NC package as possible, but if we do this instead then the custom code can simply go away entirely.  We also shore up security a bit by reducing the number of functions that use the internal REST authentication mechanism.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"DOC-1033","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Revisit BundleInstance's back end workflow","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12100":"0|i02lz3:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"10001_*:*_1_*:*_30076664557_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_56049840_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_10001":"2013-07-12T16:43:41.111-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["dmitrii(dmitrii)","gholms(gholms)","spark(spark)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/21177/comment/49676","id":"49676","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Please, work with [~gholms] on this enhancement.
