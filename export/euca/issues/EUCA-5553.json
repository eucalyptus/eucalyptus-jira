AWS:\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html\n\nEC2Config runs initial startup tasks when the instance is first started and then disables them. To run these tasks again, you must explicitly enable them prior to shutting down the instance, or by running Sysprep manually. These tasks are as follows:\n\n* Set the computer name (to match the private DNS name).\n\n* Set a random, encrypted password for the Administrator account.\n\n* Generate and install the host certificate used for Remote Desktop Connection.\n\n* Dynamically extend the operating system partition.\n\n* Execute the specified User Data (and CloudInit, if it's installed).\n\nEC2Config performs the following tasks every time the instance starts:\n\n* Check for activation status and activate Windows as necessary.\n\n* Configure the Key Management Server (KMS) and activate Windows.\n\n* Format and mount any EBS volumes and instance store volumes, and map volume names to drive letters.\n\n* Synchronize the instance clock with a time server.\n\n* Write event log entries to the console to help with troubleshooting.\n\n* Write to the console that Windows is ready.\n\n* Display wallpaper information to the desktop background.\n\n* Add a custom route to the primary network adapter to enable the following IP addresses when multiple NICs are attached: 169.254.169.250, 169.254.169.251, and 169.254.169.254. These addresses are used by Windows Activation and when you access instance metadata. (optional - not sure if its needed for on-premise clouds)\n\nWhile the instance is running, you can request that EC2Config perform the following task on demand:\n\n* Run Sysprep and shut down the instance so that you can create an AMI from it.
