Before the upgrade instances were terminated (instance store-backed) or stopped (EBS-backed instances). The cloud is using NetApp for the SAN; its a front-end (CLC, CC, SC, Walrus), HA setup.\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade, volumes can't be attached and EBS-backed.  \r\n\r\nFew things noticed:\r\n\r\n* Stale LUN mappings seem to be interfering with new connects. If we scrub the NC of sessions and then try to attach a volume to an instance-store vm, the NC re-establishes a session with the filer and so all the existing old mappings are then re-presented along with lots of volumes.\r\n* Verified that the SC is telling the NetApp to export the LUN by mapping the volume to an igroup and then having the NC connect to it. What is failing is the passing of any device on the NC through to the VM. This then causes the SC to unmap and clean up the igroup.\r\n* What appears to be causing the issue is the stale information we have pre-upgrade. The NC's are in a VERY messy state, with broken LUN assignments and ghost block devices in /proc/partitions. I'm theorising that this is the main reason why the NC cannot pass through the device. messages on the NC shows the errors we are familiar with in EUCA-3264 about incorrect mappings of block devices. Due to left over igroup information post-upgrade, the NC is also presented with a bucket load of additional volumes.\r\n\r\nProposed next step is to dump the entire igroup table contents on the SC and then filer and then reboot the node controllers.  Does this sound like a valid solution?\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"After Upgrade from 3.1.2 to 3.2.1, volume attachment fails; can't start EBS-backed instances","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12100":"0|i01ybz:","customfield_10000":"10000_*:*_1_*:*_43258_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10007_*:*_1_*:*_30293552","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":"2013-03-25T17:10:40.208-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10000","value":"Customer Affecting","id":"10000"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/11001","value":"Blocked","id":"11001"}],"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["dstagnaro(dstagnaro)","hspencer(hspencer)","lbiasi(lbiasi)"],"environment":"*HA*","customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-5523/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/20203/comment/42268","id":"42268","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dstagnaro","name":"dstagnaro","key":"dstagnaro","accountId":"557058:ab9ac2db-0ce9-444b-b209-d57d16ac0e46","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Darren Stagnaro","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"dup of EUCA-5463.
