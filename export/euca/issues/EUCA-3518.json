In general, the state of the state is the following\r\n  1. We have made a number of fixes on what happens after an NC comes back from the dead (i.e. it will disappear by default if we cannot contact it for 30 seconds).  These fixes are when things are restored back into eucalyptus, including volumes, snapshots, instances, security groups, IP addresses, etc...\r\n  2. There are procedures for the admin when NC's disappear and then reappear and get conflicts upon return (duplicate IP's, missing security groups, etc...)\r\n  3. If you run into situations where there is no procedure, we should file a new bug.  The system has been radically improved in this area from 3.0 to 3.2\r\n  4. There are also workarounds to having the NC's disappear, though they have consequences when added.   For example, one can change the timeout via CLC property for when the CLC \"forgets\" about instances/ips/security groups, but the ramification is the CLC will HOLD ON to those resources and they will not be available for use, and the admin will not be able to remove them for the specified period of time.  This this  workaround should be used with extreme caution.  If there are delays where a node cannot even get a simple ping for 30 seconds, there may be other issues to look at in the infrastructure environment, Euca configuration, or workload","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tjcramer","name":"tjcramer","key":"tjcramer","accountId":"557058:e076cf45-80ca-4b67-befb-7b0c21f32739","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tim Cramer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-02-28T12:56:32.416-0600","updated":"2013-02-28T12:56:32.416-0600"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
