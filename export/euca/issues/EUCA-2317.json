However, it does cause a considerable loss of functionality if a user encounters it, so at a minimum, we should be prepared to provide a workaround.\r\n\r\n[~decker] and I discussed this for a while yesterday.  We discussed that, while the least invasive fix is to reassign \"orphaned\" resources to the system administrator, this is a bad idea, because the resources should really still belong to the account under which they were created.  (Think about this from an AWS perspective -- an account admin would be pretty surprised if they deleted a user in their account and lost that user's volumes and snapshots.  They'd be even more surprised to find out that those were now property of the AWS \"admin\" user -- it breaks reporting/billing and all sorts of things.)\r\n\r\nI believe that the generally accepted way to deal with this sort of problem is that user deletions should use a boolean \"is deleted\" column in the user table, rather than actually deleting the user record.  I'm sure there's significant effort involved in making this work throughout the code, but I think it's the most correct solution.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=agrimm","name":"agrimm","key":"agrimm","accountId":"557058:9ebc3512-73d8-45c9-85de-4325aaa62488","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Andy Grimm","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2012-06-12T10:59:43.500-0500","updated":"2012-06-12T10:59:43.500-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/13502/comment/28047","id":"28047","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=wenye","name":"wenye","key":"wenye","accountId":"557058:410304ee-1904-4d8c-8ca1-b1148436b5a6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Ye Wen","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Chris, the suggestion here is probably good for the case of deleting an account. But in the user case, resource owners are accounts, not users. So this should not be a problem for user deletion. The real issue here is that when we need account ID for resource access check, we need to get the owning user first then to get the owning account. But there should not be the concept of \"owning user\" at all. We may tag resources with the user ID who creates them (for logging for example), but that should not get in the way when we need owning account. Resource access check should get the account ID of a resource directly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=wenye","name":"wenye","key":"wenye","accountId":"557058:410304ee-1904-4d8c-8ca1-b1148436b5a6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Ye Wen","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-06-12T12:27:01.282-0500","updated":"2012-06-12T12:27:01.282-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/13502/comment/28052","id":"28052","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=wenye","name":"wenye","key":"wenye","accountId":"557058:410304ee-1904-4d8c-8ca1-b1148436b5a6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b87135ce3de714cf85240f6d40638792?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Ye Wen","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Also for the account deletion case, which has nothing to do with this ticket. I think reassigning orphaned resources to system admin is an OK solution. In this case, the account is gone, so the resource should be recycled anyway.
