We also now handle restoration of addresses\n    when the address is not currently active. In this case the address is\n    assigned to the instance as a system address.\n    \n    In VmInstance.doUpdate:~1530 there was a duplicated case that has been\n    removed.\n    \n    Fixes EUCA-3833, EUCA-3866, EUCA-3879\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=decker","name":"decker","key":"decker","accountId":"557058:518b1ab0-12c2-4e72-b694-6c07036941a8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"do not want!

(use @grze, please)","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"(edited: after birthing this rant I'm gonna mention [~viglesias] and [~clc-team], too) \n\n[~graziano] to the best of my knowledge the issues related to instance state have been addressed between 3.2.1 and 3.3.0.  With regard to the image registrations, while we have seen it, we have never been able to systematically reproduce the bug in question.  That is, even if we did have a /\"fix\"/ we would not be able to verify and accept it.\n\nThat says we need to create the reproduction test case first.  We need to take the reproduction inter-arrival time from _months_ down to _hours/minutes_ in a single system.  If we are able to reproduce the problem even a couple of times we will either have a reasonable test case or the kind of controlled environment we need to create a focused synthetic test case.  I would suggest:\n\nh5. Attack 3.2.0 Instance restore\nI know we have seen this in the wild w/ 3.2.0.  In 3.2.0 it may be that instance restore was the main trigger for the failure.  We can test that in this scenario:\n* Split component HA w/ 2 NCs ([CLC_1][CLC_2][WS_1][WS_2][CC_1,SC_1][CC_2,SC_2][NC_1][NC_2]; each bracket being a host)\n# START w/ all COMPONENT_1 services as ENABLED and all COMPONENT_2 services up and DISABLED (healthy)\n# THEN Run an instance, call it VM_1, and where ever that VM_1 runs we call the host NC_1\n# THEN Induce a failure which partitions CLC_1/CC_1 from NC_1\n# THEN Induce a failure which partitions the CLC_1 from CLC_2\n# THEN Launch a conflicting instance, VM_2 -- which will land on NC_2, the effervescent surviving node controller\n# THEN Resolve the partitions between CLC_1 and CLC_2 (this will trigger a resync event for CLC_2)\n# THEN Resolve the partitions between CLC_1/CC_1 and NC_1 (this will trigger a restore event for the orphaned instance VM_1)\n# THEN Check the system for consistency\n\nh5. Parameter space\n\nEven in this limited scenario there is a parameter space we would have to explore.  For example, steps #3, #4, and #5 the legitimate orderings are: (345),(435),(453) [note: this last case only makes sense if VM_2 is launched using CLC_2 after the partition at step #4].  The same ordering applies for #6 and #7.  This gives a single test pass which involves 6 orderings.  Given that a single ordering will take on the order of many minutes to test against (because it involves timeouts and syncs) time saving tricks will have to be used.\n\nh5. Other similar test-needing areas\n* Walrus image uploads & registrations which overlap w/ partitions/failovers between either the walrus hosts and/or the CLC hosts\n* Volume creations or attachments which overlap with instance orphaning/restoration or partitions/failovers between either the CLC hosts or the CLC/CC hosts and the NCs\n\nh5. Reducing test times\n\n# Go into DB and tweak the instance update timestamp so we don't die of old age -- orphan the instance immediately after partitioning the NC\n# Go into DB and induce specific instance restoration conflicts:\n## Public Address Conflict\n## Private Network Index Conflict\n## Network Tag Conflict\n## Volume Attachment Conflict\n# Avoid long timeout scenarios through cleverness or hard work, but not patience.\n## See linux tcp params in EUCA-6199 related to network timeouts\n## Explicitly shutdown connection pools in order to expedite failure detection\n## Use {{ip route [add|del] [table [local|main]] [unreachable|blackhole|prohibit|reject] ADDRESS}} to simulate failures (rather than stopping the network and having to wait for the TCP stack to make up its mind).  \n## I'll post a script I've been playing around with to survey the behaviour involved; *NOTE* it is clear there are *different* failure behaviours.\n## Also, the relevant cases for {{ip route}} being applied are: destination host (blocking the sender) vs remotely (rules setup on a separate router box blocking destination route) vs. locally (rules blocking destination on the sender side). \n## See the subsequent script's main-loop for the cases\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=decker","name":"decker","key":"decker","accountId":"557058:518b1ab0-12c2-4e72-b694-6c07036941a8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"do not want!

So, when we do changes across resource types there are operations which modify one type first followed by another in a separate operation -- some kind of composition of transactions.  The ones which are subject to those kinds of composite transactions are images, security group stuff, and volumes -- and of course instances.  If that suspicion is right then the failures indicated in this ticket would manifest when an ongoing composite-transaction fails partially (which, I think, would take a network partition to happen).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=decker","name":"decker","key":"decker","accountId":"557058:518b1ab0-12c2-4e72-b694-6c07036941a8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a84cbf1ecec07d9320b42ae4fc90ccce?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddecker%26avatarId%3D16203%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"do not want!
