It will be included in service images 4.3 to support ELBs in VPC mode. Here are my findings about ec2-net-utils in EUCA 4.3.\r\n\r\n1) ec2-net-utils is a package of udev rule and the scripts that the rule invokes.\r\n2) Udev rule auto-detects newly attached interfaces, creates 'ifcfg-ethX' and 'route-ethX' file based on device information and EC2 metadata. \r\n3) It does NOT automatically ifup ethX. To activate, users (or scripts for ELB) should manually ifup ethX (there's ec2ifup, but it's identical to ifup once interface is detected).\r\n4) Route rule for the new interface is created (ip route rule), but for some reason (could be EUCA-12172), the table that the rule refers is not created when the interface is brought up (ip route list table 10001). That results in packets arriving via the new interface not routed back to the sender. 'ifup-routes ethX' fixes the problem by creating the table listed in route-ethX file.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, ec2-net-utils work well in EUCA 4.3. We probably need documentation for installation and the above workaround.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-04-13T16:43:05.904-0500","updated":"2016-04-13T16:48:09.062-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/39422/comment/105941","id":"105941","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tony","name":"tony","key":"tony","accountId":"557058:353956db-b78c-4f3b-9096-f8f58e6709c8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tony Beckham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Fix Verified.\r\n\r\nInstalled Packages\r\nName        : eucalyptus\r\nArch        : x86_64\r\nVersion     : 4.3.0\r\nRelease     : 0.25004.338.20160622git6b6bd6b.el7\r\n\r\nService images have ec2-net-utils installed and can configure ENIs.\r\nEasily observed using ELB in VPC mode seeing primary ENI used for internal traffic and secondary ENI is for the users traffic to instances registered to the ELB.
