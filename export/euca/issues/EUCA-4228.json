storage backend is overlay manager. Terminating a bfebs instance invokes detach and delete volume requests in quick succession. This results in a race condition between the two operations which may end up leaving the backing volumes on the fs\r\n\r\nFix: Synchronized volume deletion to take place only after the detachment is complete. Introduced periodic checks and faults for tgt service.

This is effectively orphaning the volume on the SC because the CLC forgets about the volume and never issues a delete operation to the SC. The SC state for the orphaned volume is completely correct and consistent, so it would delete the volume correctly if the command were issued by the CLC.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of issues at play:\r\n1. Why is the DB commit failing? Appears to be a problem updating the vm network metadata.\r\nChris claims that his fix for the network tag timeout resolves this problem. The problem is being caused by the timeout for the network resource being shorter than that for the EBS volume creation so while the CLC is waiting for the volume to create the resource timeout for the network triggers and it frees the network resource (on the CLC). When the EBS volume returns successfully the CLC tries to update the DB state and fails because it is trying an UPDATE on a row that no longer exists: the network resource row that was deleted prior. That is also why this is being manifest on TGT-based SCs because the snapshot-to-volume create operation takes longer than on a SAN, so the timeout is triggered more easily. It would be reproducible on a SAN if a Walrus download for the SAN is required or the SAN is heavily loaded. We are updating to useChris's commit this morning as of 11am-ish and re-running the bfebs churn test to see if the issue resurfaces. If all goes well then this is resolved.\r\n\r\n2. During any exception in the DB commit for VM creation, the VM state is just deleted. Network resources are explicitly released, but volumes are not. This should be addressed so that a failure, regardless of cause, will not orphan volumes associated with BFEBS instances that fail to be launched.\r\n\r\n3. CLC state for volumes is not being updated by updates from the SC. I am examining this to see how invasive and risky the fix would be. I expect it to be beyond scope for 3.2, but I want a better idea of what the code on the CLC looks like.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-30T18:14:14.420-0600","updated":"2012-11-30T18:14:33.655-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/17423/comment/36641","id":"36641","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"After looking at the code it is not feasible to have the CLC restore volume state for volumes it receives from the SC but does not already know about.
