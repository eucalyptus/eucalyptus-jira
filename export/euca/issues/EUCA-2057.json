This would greatly simplify the image\nmanagement process for some users who don't want to have to deal with pulling\nkernel and initrd out of the image. OpenStack gives the option to users\n(http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-compute/admin/content/creating-\ncustom-images.html); they can use a bootable image or a non-bootable with\nkernel and ramdisk specified. AWS uses PV-GRUB to provide this ability.\n\nThis would provide the following benefits:\n\n- It makes image management easier for users and they can leverage existing tools like Kiwi, ami-creator, boxgrinder etc. but just choosing an image type/option and not having to worry about kernel and ramdisk\n\n- It would circumvent the IAM semantic whereby users cannot register kernel and ramdisks, allowing users to perform image upload, registration and launch. This would suit private cloud users and matches how Amazon have enabled user-provided kernels via PV-GRUB\n\n- It might simplify P2V migrations; it's much quicker just to image a machine and register the bootable disk\n\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-24","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/attachment/11921","id":"11921","filename":"initrd.img-3.2.0-27-virtual","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=orenault","name":"orenault","key":"orenault","accountId":"557058:b4c2692b-cd19-4228-839c-3ef83c58683a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f14a44189e323b53e5517770676554c8?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Olivier
