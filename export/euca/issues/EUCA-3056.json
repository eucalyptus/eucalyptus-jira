The customer complaint around this is if the names are arbitrary tags as you suggest, then it shouldn't matter what we set any of the fields to, but our testing does not match this.\n\nFrom what we can see, as long as the CPU values and memory values are the exact same across various VM types, you can freely change the Disk allocation to be less than, equal to, or significantly greater (as long as it does not exceed the next VM type where CPU and Memory are higher).\n\nFor example, we set m1.small and c1.medium to the exact same CPU and Memory.  m1.small had a Disk of 5GB, c1.medium had 20GB.  Then we set m1.large to more CPU, more Memory, and a 50GB Disk.  We were then able to increase the Disk on m1.small to anything up to 50GB. From what we can tell, this same functionality/behavior does not work the same way if we attempt to have the CPU or Memory be the variable.\n\nIf it is working as designed, I think our customers would find it easier to manage if we were consistent (and documented the expected behavior).

The strangeness happens when you set two to be equal, and then change one.  If you ever set two vm types to be identical, then changing one may change its ordering in the list based on what it is changed to.  for example if you start with\n\n(name, cpu, mem, disk)\na 1, 1000, 2\nb 2, 2000, 4\nc 4, 4000, 8\nd 8, 8000, 16\n\nthen\n\na 1, 1000, 2\nb 1, 1000, 2\nc 4, 4000, 8\nd 8, 8000, 16\n\nthen change 'a' to '4, 4000, 16', you should end up with\n\nb 1, 1000, 2\nc 4, 4000, 8\na 4, 4000, 16\nd 8, 8000, 16\n\nnote that the strict ordering of the cpu/mem/disk is still present (i.e. there is no type that has one value greater than and another value less than another type), but it moves the position of 'a'.\n\nI believe the situation you've described still conforms to the above model (at the end of the day, the type ordering is still maintained).  please correct me if i'm wrong.\n\nBTW I'm not trying to argue that this is clear or intuitive, but rather am just clarifying 'how it works today'.  Unless you see an out of order list WRT to the values of CPU/mem/disk (not type name), then it is working as designed, and it is consistent.  Documenting the expected behavior and/or improving the UX in this regard can certainly be spun off as related issues, I think.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=nurmi","name":"nurmi","key":"nurmi","accountId":"557058:68718820-f5e0-4305-a46c-f867a6bc9565","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7ac3bd8409137b5a6a6f8fc7d6e5f94b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dnurmi%26avatarId%3D10601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Daniel Nurmi","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2012-08-01T15:46:22.685-0500","updated":"2012-08-01T15:46:22.685-0500"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-3056/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
