Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks, [~spark] and [~sjones] for comments.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, some fault-handling code can and should be generic -- i.e., not specific to the type of task -- and that's what Sang-Min has described. What he has built makes sense to me, including leaving volume-state decisions up to task-specific logic (since not every task involves volumes). My questions on generic fault handling are:\r\n\r\n* Should there be an overall timeout and maybe retry limit associated with a task that the generic mechanism could enforce? (Otherwise, each task type is likely to re-implement that logic.)\r\n\r\n* Is there any reason not to always enable {{imaging.imaging_worker_healthcheck}}?\r\n\r\nWhen the health check is enabled, task-specific logic will have to handle the cases in which tasks are restarted, which would reset their progress indicators back to beginning. I think that's okay, but just something that status-reporting logic must be prepared for.\r\n\r\nIf health check is always enabled and able to handle timeouts, then task-specific logic can be simpler: It does _no_ timeout handling in this case. It needs to decide what the timeout should be and whether tasks should be resubmitted by the health-checker, associating those parameters with the task. While the task is pending (either queued or being executed), task-specific logic does whatever it wants with task status -- maybe relaying it back to the user, maybe logging it periodically -- being prepared for any progress indicator to get reset. Once the task is finished, either successfully or not, task-specific logic cleans up buckets and volumes, if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the specific case of tasks that populate volumes with data, I believe restarting the imaging worker instance will not be problematic for volumes: \r\n\r\n1) task-specific logic allocates a volume\r\n2) when executing a task, imaging worker instance attaches a volume to itself\r\n3) if imaging worker instance is unhealthy and gets terminated, any volumes attached to it will be detached\r\n4) if the failed task gets re-queued, a new imaging worker instance will be able to pick up at step (2)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-05T16:29:33.368-0500","updated":"2014-04-05T16:29:33.368-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/28703/comment/66965","id":"66965","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~dmitrii] Finally back to this question:\r\n\r\nIs there any reason not to always enable?: I think eventually we will turn it on, but turned off for now because it will be annoying during the development (i.e., a vm may terminate without notice)\r\n\r\nTask time-out and retry limit: I think it's a good idea and it will cover the case where a task is valid from worker's  standpoint while it keeps holding resources and doesn't do anything useful.
