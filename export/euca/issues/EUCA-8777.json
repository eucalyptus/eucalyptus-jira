As a cloud infra admin / resource admin / account admin, I expect the cloud to provide me options to free up some / all resources used by low-priority instances, so that I have full control over how the low-priority instances are being managed\r\n\r\n    - As a cloud infra admin / resource admin / account admin, I expect the cloud to free up slots used by low-priority instances when certain (agreed upon) conditions are met, so that I don't have to be responsible for cleaning up slots taken up by low-priority instances.\r\n\r\n    -
