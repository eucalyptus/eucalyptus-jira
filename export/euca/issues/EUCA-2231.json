So as to guarantee that there will always be instances running in any case of single NC failure. This can be done in a way similar as round-robin, e.g. filter based round-robin; i.e. each time launching instances checking whether the filter configuration requires them to be on different instances, if Yes, launch the instance in a different NC with considering also other factor; if not, go directly with the normal round-robin; filter is configurable based on service.\r\n\r\nThe reason I think current round-robin can not solve the problem is because, there could be multiple services and multiple instances launched in the same platform, operations can not guarantee this is done sequentially. Also when instance or NC node failure happens, there is no way to make sure the redeployment is not happening on the same NC with another instance. If you think there is other functionality can fulfill our requirement, please clarify more,thanks.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-44","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":" 3rd scheduler policy which could consider a kind of host-unaffinity","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=nbeard","name":"nbeard","key":"nbeard","accountId":"557058:0d3a01f5-ec79-48de-8d8f-79bd6a2c5cb3","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f26add140f84a617d35f2b4cbed36f47?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dnbeard%26avatarId%3D10207%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f26add140f84a617d35f2b4cbed36f47?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dnbeard%26avatarId%3D10207%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f26add140f84a617d35f2b4cbed36f47?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dnbeard%26avatarId%3D10207%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f26add140f84a617d35f2b4cbed36f47?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dnbeard%26avatarId%3D10207%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Neil Beard","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=nbeard","name":"nbeard","key":"nbeard","accountId":"557058:0d3a01f5-ec79-48de-8d8f-79bd6a2c5cb3","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f26add140f84a617d35f2b4cbed36f47?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dnbeard%26avatarId%3D10207%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f26add140f84a617d35f2b4cbed36f47?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dnbeard%26avatarId%3D10207%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f26add140f84a617d35f2b4cbed36f47?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dnbeard%26avatarId%3D10207%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/f26add140f84a617d35f2b4cbed36f47?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dnbeard%26avatarId%3D10207%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Neil Beard","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_13316329509_*|*_10001_*:*_1_*:*_145670681941","customfield_12100":"0|i01c1z:","customfield_10001":"2012-05-30T21:13:43.345-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":["Instance-Placement-PM"],"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["agrimm(agrimm)","nbeard(nbeard)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/13314/comment/34444","id":"34444","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=agrimm","name":"agrimm","key":"agrimm","accountId":"557058:9ebc3512-73d8-45c9-85de-4325aaa62488","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Andy Grimm","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"I'm confirming this issue, since it is at least clear what is being requested.
