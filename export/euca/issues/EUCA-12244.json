There are at least two situations where additional records which fall within the same Eucalyptus region/domain are often needed. It would be useful to have a way to add such records to the set of returned results.\r\n\r\nThese two areas are for the console and mail. For example:\r\n\r\nFor a cloud which uses the domain hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net, just as I can access the compute service via ec2.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net, I'd like to access the console via console.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net. I'd also like to be able to add smtp.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net (or smtp1.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net and smtp2.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net) and imap.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net (or imap1.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net and imap2.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net) as A records and corresponding MX records which point to these smtp records, so internal email servers can lookup what mail servers to use via DNS.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to inject more than one console and smtp A record, when multiple consoles are created for HA or load-balancing reasons.\r\n\r\nIdeally, in the case of the console, any logic used to detect and modify the set of returned result records for UFS based services should also be used to detect and modify the set of results for the console. By this I mean, if we have code which monitors the availability of all ec2 service endpoints when multiple UFS servers are configured, and which removes those which don't respond, adding them back when they return to health, we should implement the same logic to test the health and add/remove console DNS results so only healthy consoles are returned.\r\n\r\nUntil it is possible to do this, it doesn't currently seem possible to create a DNS A record for a console such as console.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net. This means I can't use the same *.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net wildcard SSL certificate to protect the console Nginx endpoint as I'm using to protect all other UFS-based services. I'd really like to do this if possible.\r\n\r\nUntil this is possible, I am using as a workaround the following convention: I use console-hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net (note the hyphen after console). This prevents use of the standard wildcard. I am modifying the SSL CSR to include as an additional Subject Alternative Name this value with the hyphen, which allows me to use the issued cert with this alternate value, but i don't consider this a good long-term solution. And, this solution doesn't fix the mail issue.\r\n\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Provide method to inject additional DNS records into UFS DNS results","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_8622422_*|*_10001_*:*_1_*:*_36103063078","customfield_12100":"0|i03pxj:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":"2016-04-21T18:27:12.945-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10000","value":"Customer Affecting","id":"10000"}],"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["jgallucci32(jgallucci32)","mcrawford(mcrawford)","spark(spark)"],"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/42420/comment/101849","id":"101849","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I could certainly see the benefit of this feature request. There are bigger problems from the design & implementation perspectives.\r\n\r\n1) Because Console was designed as a standalone service that has its own lifecycle, adding it as UFS would be significant engineering. Also each UFS is to provide a AWS API (EC2, ELB, Autoscale, etc), but console itself is not providing an API. \r\n2) Our DNS implementation is quite different from the conventional DNS servers in that it does not use any \"DNS tables\". It rather implements \"resolvers\" that is service specific and uses the service's database to answer queries. So hosting any non-EUCA records would need a new implementation approach.\r\n\r\nHave we considered using ELBs to host consoles? Because console is designed as a standalone web service, it would make more sense to host it behind ELBs. ELB's health-check and DNS resolution would then take care of its service lifecycle. It would not fix the wildcard SSL issue though because there is extra level in the loadbalancer's DNS name (i.e., console.lb.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net). If needed, we can fix that relatively easily. If deployment effort is a concern, we could release the console as VM image and provide CF template (like we do for imaging service).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-04-21T18:27:12.945-0500","updated":"2016-04-21T18:27:12.945-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/42420/comment/102715","id":"102715","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think making the console as a VM image and treating it like the imaging service is a *great* idea - please do this! We have a way to load balance UFS when multiple are running via the DNS service, but don't have the same with the Console, and this would solve that problem, plus remove the hassle of installing this separately.\r\n\r\nBut, that's a slightly different problem than what I think needs to be done here. We need a way to have UFS DNS resolve a name for the console using a name similar in format to those used for other UFS, like ec2 (i.e. if ec2 service reachable via ec2.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net, then console service - however it is architected - should be reachable via console.hpe-atlpss-1.atlpss.hp.net). I can imaging we will eventually need smtp or imap too for sending or receiving status emails.\r\n\r\nThis is why I suggested having some method of injecting additional DNS records, like a property which populates a database table which UFS DNS could query as a secondary source of such records if it was not one of the set of services it looks up by the dynamic method you mention in your comment above.\r\n\r\nif we move the console to a design similar to the imaging service - again, great idea, just make sure there's properties to adjust the min/max instance count in the CFN ASG - there should be additional logic somewhere which updates the DNS record(s) returned for the console to match the ELB which directs traffic.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-10T13:06:53.992-0500","updated":"2016-05-10T13:06:53.992-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/42420/comment/102716","id":"102716","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jgallucci32","name":"jgallucci32","key":"jgallucci32","accountId":"557058:1cd98ee4-b2ee-4683-a315-2a6abd75b048","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"John Gallucci","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~mcrawford], I would argue that making the console a service image offers no real advantage here.  Today we run our Console on a VMware virtual machine and having it sit outside of the cloud makes it easier to maintain, debug issues. There are less dependencies on the core components of Eucalyptus making updates more flexible. The fact it uses python and java script means we can apply same-day fixes to resolve any bugs (e.g. The leap-year bug for the 29th of Feb caused an issue which was resolved by modifying a single line in python).  Had the image been included with the Eucalyptus baseline this would have been more difficult to do as the service image is an instance-store image.  This would require the released changes need to be rolled into a new image since the service images use ephemeral storage.\r\n\r\nNow your comment about DNS resolvers is spot on, and quite frankly I think a big design issue that needs to be addressed by the Eucalyptus team.  There is no standard way to register these services other than to pre-bake them into the release (or find some way to execute some clever java commands which i'm in the process of figuring out).  If service registration was user configurable, then X number of services could be added, and in a dynamic fashion.  This would be more of the micro service approach that I believe Eucalyptus should be going towards (for 5.0 I would expect a micro service architecture, which is sounds like the team is going in that direction).\r\n\r\nI think in general the lack of a micro service architecture is what is hurting the ability to add these changes dynamically.  Making service registration dynamic and available to users is one sure way to enable this capability. Another good use case for this would be installing Comcast CMB in lieu of an integrated SNS/SQS solution.  I can deploy my own, but having it have the same HTTP endpoint structure as the rest of the cloud is really what makes it...well...cloud.  Waiting for this solution to become baked into a release slows down the operating tempo of my deployment.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jgallucci32","name":"jgallucci32","key":"jgallucci32","accountId":"557058:1cd98ee4-b2ee-4683-a315-2a6abd75b048","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"John Gallucci","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-10T13:31:53.764-0500","updated":"2016-05-10T13:31:53.764-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/42420/comment/102722","id":"102722","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~mcrawford] [~jgallucci32] That was very useful insights! Regarding the timeline, customizable DNS cannot be included in 4.3 because we are past the feature freeze and the current architecture doesn't allow us to do it in timely manner. In 5.0, we will also discuss implementing Route53 as a fully-fledged DNS service. I see making console as a EUCA dependent service has both pros and cons. I think this is one area that we should improve. It's true debugging and updating imaging service takes quite an effort and it's not really customizable in the sense that EUCA release cycles and customer fix doesn't go with well. We need better architecture and tooling to make the release faster and customer driven. Then making console as the image-based service will bring real benefit.
