features to compete with current AWS offerings of ELB with EC2-VPC.\r\n\r\nAt some point Eucalyptus is going to need to dump the legacy network modes. VPC is the default standard‎ and since 2015 new accounts created on AWS can only use EC2-VPC mode. Maintaining backward compatibility will become a burden sooner or later.  When this happens using ELBs in an EC2 classic fashion on a VPC will limit the capabilities of the load balancer.\r\n\r\nThis ticket should at least be kept in the backlog until the above mentioned comes to fruition.\r\n  Original Message\r\nFrom: Steve Jones (JIRA)\r\nSent: Friday, October 14, 2016 2:17 PM\r\nTo: Gallucci, John (US)\r\nSubject: [JIRA] (EUCA-12817) Use MidoNet load balancer in place of service image\r\n\r\n\r\n*** WARNING ***\r\nEXTERNAL EMAIL -- This message originates from outside our organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [ https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-12817?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=111471#comment-111471 ]\r\n\r\nSteve Jones commented on EUCA-12817:\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFor a functional elb we need to be able to support policy driven ssl with user controlled certificates, uploading logs to s3, submission of metrics to cloudwatch, etc. We also need a non-vpc solution, so adding vpc specific functionality would most likely mean having support for multiple implementations of the same functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nThis message was sent by Atlassian JIRA\r\n(v1000.383.2#100014)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jgallucci32","name":"jgallucci32","key":"jgallucci32","accountId":"557058:1cd98ee4-b2ee-4683-a315-2a6abd75b048","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"John Gallucci","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-10-17T21:35:48.604-0500","updated":"2016-10-17T21:35:48.604-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
