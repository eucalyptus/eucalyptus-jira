Eucalyptus is a set of engineered components working in concert together.  Eucalyptus needs to control how these components are installed and configured, otherwise the testing would be impossible.  For example, what if the running postgreSQL was an untested rev?  or what if certain options were provided which subtly changed how it operates?   Being a *very key* component to the system, just as DRDB is, we really must understand and control the dependence.   This is no different than other dependencies in the system.\n\nI realize this is a request, but the testing/qualification and potential issues that support would need to be able to debug would be large and unwieldly.

Pushing this argument to the extreme means that we will need to come up with our own distribution to control the dependencies;\n- controlled configuration: may we have some examples and reasons why we need such a tight control over a standard piece of software like a DB?  Is it performance? Is it correctness?\n- changed behavior: if we are so dependent on a specific version of postgresql's features then, which features are they, and can we workaround them to use straight sql? \n\nI see a lot of benefit to ensure that we can talk to any sql DB (I assume sql since we are using postgres) and been able to not care about the backend (portability, more flexibility on the sysadmin side, less dependencies to package, less configuration to carry each release), but if the cost outweigh the above benefits, then we shouldn't care.\n\nIn short, feel free to close this ticket and review the sister ticket EUCA-6375.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=graziano","name":"graziano","key":"graziano","accountId":"557058:c440cc9e-8398-4f2e-8588-bdd59e3a7cf8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Graziano Obertelli","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-22T18:49:11.401-0500","updated":"2013-05-22T18:49:11.401-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/21634/comment/46400","id":"46400","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hey [~tjcramer],\n\nSo if we require a specific version of Postgres to be on the system,  isn't this part of having package dependencies?   Additionally, if we are worried about certain dependencies being updated to an unsupported rev, shouldn't we have it as part of the installation documentation for the user to check \"somewhere\" (i.e. a web page, release docs, etc.) for the tested versions of Postgres?  You mentioned DRBD, besides starting, stopping, enabling, disabling, syncing (which is typical for applications to interact with DRBD hence the drbdadm tool) what other dependencies do we need to control regarding that application?  \n\nThe thing that I have been hearing from various users is that there are applications that have a defined way of interacting with them.  Why are we going against those defined ways (i.e. starting postgres via \"service postgres start\")?  \n\n The behavior that you are mentioning above is more like an appliance model, not an application that is utilizing other open source applications running on the system.  Is my observation incorrect?\n\nThanks for helping us understand this issue.  Look forward to hearing more regarding this topic.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-23T00:50:01.440-0500","updated":"2013-05-23T00:50:01.440-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/21634/comment/46476","id":"46476","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tjcramer","name":"tjcramer","key":"tjcramer","accountId":"557058:e076cf45-80ca-4b67-befb-7b0c21f32739","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tim Cramer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~gholms] suggests 2 things may be asked for here.  \n  1.
