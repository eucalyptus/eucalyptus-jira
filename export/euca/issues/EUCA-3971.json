The basic mechanism is about open 2 sockets for every connection, one to the client and other to the real server, and then deliver the raw data between them. The selection of this method could be adecuated for protocols like SMTP, RDP, IMAP, LDAP, SSH, etc.\r\n\r\n* UDP: It's a simple load balancing that deliver traffic in raw UDP data. The basic mechanism is about open 2 sockets for every connection, one to the client and other to the real server, and then deliver the raw data between them. The selection of this method could be adecuated for protocols like DNS, NTP, TFTP, BOOTP, SNMP, etc.\r\n\r\n* HTTP: It's an advanced only HTTP layer 7 load balancing (or Application Delivery Controller) with proxy special properties. This method is adecuated for web services (web application servers included) and all application protocols based on HTTP protocol like WebDav, RDP over HTTP, ICA over HTTP, etc.\r\n\r\n* HTTPS: It's an advanced only HTTPS layer 7 load balancing (or Application Delivery Controller) combinated with SSL wrapper acceleration. In this case, the communication between the client and the load balancer is secure through HTTPS, meanwhile the communication between the load balancer and the real server is clear through HTTP.\r\n\r\n*HTTP/HTTPs Session stickiness (both application level and load balancer level)* – Yes, but not documented well.\r\n\r\n*DNS vhosting* - No.\r\n\r\n*Endpoint health monitoring* - Yes\r\n\r\n*Metric collection* \r\n    *Latency* – No\r\n    *RequestCount* – WebUI and Logs\r\n    *HTTP Response code counts (e.g., 400, 404, 500, etc.)* – Available in the logs.  Also can configure custom HTTP error responses.\r\n\r\n*Additional Notes* \r\n\r\nThis is an appliance.  The OS is based off of Debian.  Pretty straight forward to configure everything through the WebUI.  Configuration of \"farms\" (i.e. clusters of real server applications) and Cluster of LBs is an option.  Looking at the logs, it seems that its using pound to do the load balancing.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nThu Nov 1 23:55:46 2012 - * - 192.168.7.1 - admin - running /usr/local/zenloadbalancer/app/pound/sbin/pound -f /usr/local/zenloadbalancer/config/Nginx-Test_pound.cfg -p /var/run//Nginx-Test_pound.pid\r\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-01T22:34:40.481-0500","updated":"2012-11-01T23:42:14.369-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/16749/comment/37489","id":"37489","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/architecture/blob/master/features/elb/3.3/elb-benchmark.wiki\n\nthe wiki has the latest benchmark results.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-12-12T15:45:08.774-0600","updated":"2012-12-12T15:45:08.774-0600"}],"maxResults":5,"total":5,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
