However, this gives zero control over how cores are allocated to VMs and how the NC itself will be given CPU cycles.\r\n\r\nOvercommitment of CPU has the risk that the NC itself may be starved for cycles which can lead to stability issues for the NC and system if the NC cannot respond to messages from the CC or other components or perform internal maintenance tasks. There needs to be a reliable way to configure how overcommit of CPU can be safely handled on the NC.\r\n\r\nIn Scrum parlance:\r\nAs an admin I woud like to be able to configure significant CPU overcommit for only VMs on an NC while still reserving some configurable amount of CPU capacity for the NC itself.\r\n\r\nRequirements for solution:\r\n* The solution must, at minimum, allow core-level granularity of overcommit and reserved capacity for the NC. \r\n* The solution must be configurable on a per-host/NC basis.\r\n* Must not require additional scheduling for VMs or consideration by any other component of the system. Must be transparent to all other hosts and components.\r\n\r\nExample for a 16 core system: \r\nReserved NC cores: 2, \r\nVM cores: 28\r\n\r\nAdditional constraints:\r\n* Semantics must be consistent and supported for both KVM and VMware\r\n* May allow core-affinity, but not strictly required.\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Fine grained CPU overcommit control for Node Controller hosts","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_125619736360","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i0241r:","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["zhill(zhill)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-6586/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
