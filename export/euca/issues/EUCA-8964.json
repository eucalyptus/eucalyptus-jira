Gangisetty","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"In case of KVM the NC does not know where the volume gets attached, so it always reports the device string to CLC as \"unknown,requested:/dev/xyz\". CLC reformats this string to /dev/xyz before persisting it to the database. The device string escapes the reformatting process on the CLC in some intermittent cases. This has been around for a while and although the device string looks weird, the volume could be detached and reused before the following commit:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\ncommit 315573edfbbfd1c9f21e654941431b082788b8b5\r\nAuthor: mmunn <mmunn@eucalyptus.com>\r\nDate:   Thu Oct 3 11:51:44 2013 -0700\r\n\r\n    EUCA-7710 missing input validation on CLC\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nThis commit added a validation check for the device string stored in the database on the detach volume path. Its not strictly needed (since the volume is already attached and there is no point to checking the validity of the device string during detachment). I will be removing the check as a fix for EUCA-8330. \r\n\r\nThe issue of CLC reporting the device string as \"unknown,requested:/dev/xyz\" would need a bigger change either in the CLC or NC. In my opinion, there is not much value in the NC reporting the unknown status as it gets thrown away by the CLC. It might be a much cleaner approach to just make the NC report the device string as it received and also get rid of device string reformatting logic on the CLC. The fix has a potential of causing churn, regression and might need a lot of test cycles. I would incline towards dealing with it post 4.0. \r\n\r\n[~tjcramer], [~dkavanagh]: Would it be okay to push this out of the 4.0 release?
