Thomas","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Initial investigation shows that the bundle information is in the same table as the instance information, meaning there is at any given time at most one bundle per instance.  In addition, bundling the same bundle id, for example, if the instance is: i-4A253E94, any bundle created with that instance will be called bun-4A253E94\r\n\r\nThere are therefore a couple of issues here.\r\n1) Only one bundle at a time can occur with an instance.  An attempt to create a bundle while another bundle of the same instance is in progress will be lost.\r\n2) There is no useful way to describe bundle tasks uniquely.  Each bundle task associated with an instance will have the same id.\r\n3) There is no \"bundle_task\" table to show the history of completed (success or failure) bundle attempts.\r\n\r\nTo \"fix\" this situation, the following would have to occur\r\n1) Bundle task id's would have to be globally unique, the simplest might be something like bun-<instance-id>-<bundle-number>\r\n2) Somewhere to store the bundle history would be required, either a cache like terminated instances has now or a separate table.  The former would clear old values on CLC reboot, the latter would have to have some mechanism to delete old values.  (One of the above 3 suggestions in the initial comment)\r\n3) [Possible]  Bundle requests would need to be queuable.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be an \"enhancement\" level of request at the moment.\r\n\r\nTo deal with the immediate issue of not being able to see what happens when the bundle is completed, we may be able to leave the final bundle state in the instance table, but that may have other consequences that would have to be investigated.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ethomas","name":"ethomas","key":"ethomas","accountId":"557058:8f092f9a-0724-44c0-84a3-0220705f856a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Evan Thomas","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-19T14:20:06.554-0500","updated":"2013-09-19T14:20:06.554-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/23862/comment/53630","id":"53630","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ethomas","name":"ethomas","key":"ethomas","accountId":"557058:8f092f9a-0724-44c0-84a3-0220705f856a","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a01d066493c57e5dee4b94dc87395576?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Evan Thomas","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Adding a new db table and changing the bundle id tasks are beyond the scoping for 3.4 this late in the game, but an easy way to address the immediate issue (seeing if jobs have succeeded or failure) can be implemented by a one off cache, jobs would be available in the euca-describe-bundle-tasks until another bundle-instance is run against the same instance (or clc reboot).
