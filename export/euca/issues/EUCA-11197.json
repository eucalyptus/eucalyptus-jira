But in Eucalyptus this is not possible. \r\n\r\nToday customers are asking us for this particular feature because this would greatly assist them in automating and reducing the time it takes to migrate running EBS instances (on SAN backend) from one Eucalyptus cloud to another Eucalyptus in different geo location.\r\n\r\nMore detail on the use cases can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-copy-snapshot.html\r\n\r\nParticular interest from paid Eucalyptus customers is coming on the following scenario:\r\n\r\nMigration: Move an application to a new region, to enable better availability and minimize cost.\r\n\r\nDisaster recovery: Back up your data and logs across different geographical locations at regular intervals. In case of disaster, you can restore your applications using point-in-time backups stored in the secondary region. This minimizes data loss and recovery time.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know when we can expect this feature to be implemented in Eucalyptus.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDeependra","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Support for copying snapshot across regions","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"customfield_12100":"0|i03bjb:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_145379876_*|*_10001_*:*_1_*:*_59087780110","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10000","value":"Customer Affecting","id":"10000"}],"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["dshekhawat(dshekhawat)","vasya(vasya)"],"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-11197/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
