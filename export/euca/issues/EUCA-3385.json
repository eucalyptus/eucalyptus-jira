The current info on github is accurate for 3.1, but there were some changes in 3.2 for the Overlay/TGT SC that have changed how we manage the loopbacks and LVM volumes. We do the same basic steps, but we tear things down after creating the volume so that loopbacks are not used until the volume is attached. We basically just disable the lvm LV and then free the loopback. I will update the page with a 3.2 version when I get a chance. I will be updating it for snapshots as well, but I'm not sure exactly when.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-14T22:53:16.208-0600","updated":"2013-01-14T22:53:16.208-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/15503/comment/57315","id":"57315","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~hspencer], how's this? https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/wiki/Storage-Controller.
