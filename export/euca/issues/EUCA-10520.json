manual install. This has the pk/cert and env vars in eucarc, but the service URLs are incomplete, some not working, or using IP addresses. When I add DNS or finish system config so broken URLs are fixed, I must (or normally) re-get credentials to obtain an updated eucarc with working URLs. Before 4.1, when I did this, my eucarc would contain the env vars and the zip would contain the pk/cert these env vars pointed to, so everything still worked.\r\n\r\n4.1.0 broke that. Now, once I finish config, or the first time I re-get credentials, actually, I'm left with a broken eucarc file, which no longer contains env vars required for the image related commands to work, despite the fact I still have valid pk/cert files from the original admin.zip expansion.\r\n\r\nThis is my suggestion, run past Vic, who suggested I create this ticket, and put in the demo scripts I'm working on, to get them working again. For me, this works, Not particularly happy or unhappy with how, but I need something other than a broken eucarc after I re-get credentials.

scripts is more logically correct.  There is no real logic behind creating new sets of keys and downloading them during the install process, if that can be avoided, IMHO. So, increasing the number of keys which can co-exist so the prior method remains possible seems to me more of a fix which exposed prior bad practice than a real solution.\r\n\r\nIf we're going to limit the user to only downloading credentials once - which I agree with, as the original requestor should have confidence they are the only person in possession of the private key unless they choose to share it, then I think the best solution is to figure out some way to notify them that they need to save these keys for future use which may span additional attempts to download credentials, when the purpose of such additional credentials downloads is not due to a need for new credentials (for valid reasons like a security breach or rotation), but simply the mechanics of the manual install process.\r\n\r\nI have a new suggestion - to use a method similar to what we use now for un-configured services, where instead of the line which exports the ENV var, in the same place we have an echo statement which warns that the prior key and cert must be used. What I'd add here, is to have this warning message include the pk and cert filenames, including the unique identifier, so it's clear what files must be used.\r\n\r\nI think this would be helpful, but I don't think this creates any additional security issues, as an additional user fetching credentials still would not have the original pk and cert files of such names.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael
