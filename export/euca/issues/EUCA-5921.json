future readers):\n\nOn the NC, where the instance runs, there is a file /usr/share/eucalyptus/floppy , the NC copies this file to the instance work directory, during the instance creation, this file when loopback mounted, has a file configuration.xml that looks like following, originally\n\n{code}\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<Configuration xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" version=\"0.1\" xmlns=\"http://eucalyptus.com\">\n  <Hostname>MAGICEUCALYPTUSHOSTNAMEPLACEHOLDER</Hostname>\n  <LocalAccount>\n\t<Username>Administrator</Username>\n\t<Password>MAGICEUCALYPTUSPASSWORDPLACEHOLDER</Password>\n  </LocalAccount>\n  <ActiveDirectory xsi:nil=\"true\" />\n</Configuration>\n{code}\n\nNow the NC reads this file and replaces \"MAGICEUCALYPTUSHOSTNAMEPLACEHOLDER\" and \"MAGICEUCALYPTUSPASSWORDPLACEHOLDER\" with the correct values during instance creation, relevant code is here \n\nhttps://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus/blob/testing/storage/storage-windows.c#L434-L446\n\nAfter the changes are done, the modified file is presented to the instance inside A:\\\\ (floppy drive), the Eucalyptus windows service reads this file and modifies \"computer name\" and \"password\" accordingly.\n\nNow if we change the \"computer name\" from inside the instance, the instance needs to be rebooted, when it comes up, the Eucalyptus windows service again reads the configuration.xml file in A:\\\\ and again applies the same changes, that is setting the \"computer name\" to the instance ID (as the configuration.xml still has the instance ID as the computer name in it).\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold
