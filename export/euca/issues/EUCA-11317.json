With AWS there are defined identifier formats that do not have provision for such namespacing. With region federation we partition the identifier space using a prefix to allow ~1000 \"namespaces\" that can be allocated to regions. \r\n\r\nWithout identifier partitioning performance would be poor, every new resource would require reserving a name in every region, and every use of a credential would require looking up the related identifier in every region.\r\n\r\nWith an existing cloud the identifiers will be allocated across the available identifier range which may make partitioning impossible without changing identifiers. If there are available prefixes then it is currently possible to add a new region.
