Even though the storage for each host may be provided by another system (i.e. SAN) both capacity and IO bandwidth in and out of the Walrus service are limited by a single host's capabilities. As deployments grow in size and usage it is necessary for administrators to be able to add both capacity and bandwidth to the Walrus/S3 service to meet demand. It is also necessary that the service be resilient to host failures and network anomalies (within reason).\r\n\r\n*In Scrum Parlance:*\r\nAs an infrastructure administrator I would like to be able to scale Walrus capacity and IO bandwidth to match my workloads without having to take the service online so that I can seamlessly grow my resources without interrupting the users.\r\n\r\n*NOTE on terminology of requirements:*\r\nMUST=Hard requirement\r\nMAY=Optional\r\n\r\n*Functional Requirements:*\r\n* MUST be able to add storage capacity to the system with zero downtime or loss of availability of the existing data.\r\n* MUST be able to add bandwidth capacity to the system with zero downtime or loss of availability of existing data.\r\n** explicitly must support multiple active data paths for upload/download.\r\n* MUST be able to replace failed hosts in the system seamlessly without manual data movement in normal operation.\r\n* MUST present the S3 API to users of the Walrus/S3 service in a seamless way that does not change based on the size of the system.\r\n* MUST continue to support IAM integration with Eucalyptus user identities for all supported S3 actions in EUARE (IAM).\r\n* MUST provide eventual consistency, as per S3 semantics and API.\r\n* MUST ensure that any given data object is not lost due to failure of a single host.\r\n* MUST NOT lose data due to failure of any single host. Data durability.\r\n* MUST NOT require manual data movement from existing machines in the system to newly added machines. This should be handled automatically and managed by the system.\r\n* MAY provide a direct upgrade path from single-host or dual-HA Walrus installations without administrator intervention.\r\n* MAY provide a scale-out path from a single host to many active hosts providing Walrus service.\r\n* MAY ensure that any given data object is not lost due to failure of a subset (>1) of hosts.\r\n\r\n*Performance:*\r\n* Not specifically addressed. Best effort is acceptable.\r\n* Single operation latency is not as important as aggregate throughput in the system.\r\n* Operations to external users should have same performance as Eucalyptus-internal operations, as allowed by network config etc (no service differentiation based on source)\r\n* Some form of fair-sharing of bandwidth would be beneficial, but is not required.\r\n* *Target:* able to saturate external network links on Walrus hosts (links to the client, not internal)\r\n\r\n*Availability:*\r\n* Cannot process requests without identity services, so there is a dependency. This feature will not specifically address availability of the Eucalyptus identity services.\r\n* Maintain availability in presence of N - 1 Walrus-API host failures.\r\n* Target: 100% of Eucalyptus user identity availability (i.e. the user identity service). Failure of a single host should not render the system unavailable\r\n\r\n*Data Durability:*\r\n* > durability of single hard-drive (not sure on exact # of 9s) \r\n* Data only lost if *all* replicas are corrupted/failed.\r\n\r\n*Reliability:*\r\n* In-flight operations may fail due to host failure\r\n* MTTF?\r\n\r\n*Scalability:*\r\n* Scale IO and storage capacity depending on configuration (e.g. add drives to current systems, add new systems)\r\n* Scale Target: 100s of simultaneous users, 10^6 objects, 10^5 buckets, more is better, but that is a testable goal. 5GB objects, using single upload, 5TB using multipart-upload (when implemented). >10 systems used to provide storage (100s would be better, but not sure if we can test that in-house)\r\n\r\n*Security:*\r\n* MUST respect IAM policies, object & bucket ACLS, and bucket policies (when implemented).\r\n* MUST not require special access on any of the backend hosts--backend hosts are opaque other than service interface\r\n* MUST not require services to run as root on hosts, should be able to run with reduced privileges.\r\n\r\n*Upgrade:*\r\n* MUST support warm upgrades (requests may be rejected but service is available for connection) moving forward.\r\n* MUST support metadata changes in subsequent versions.\r\n* MAY service user operations during upgrade (not required)\r\n* MAY support operation with non-identical component versions (e.g. Walrus on different versions on different hosts) (again, optional, not a hard requirement, yet).","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-27","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Scalable
