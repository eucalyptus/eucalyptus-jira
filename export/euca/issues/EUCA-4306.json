Van Rood","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I vote against HAProxy as a general purpose cloud load balancer.\nthe prod branch doesn't terminate SSL yet, which means compared to more mature SSL balancers (nginx) it will be playing catch-up for quite a while.\nThe developer, Willy, is very outspoken against backend servers having dynamic addresses, much to the chagrin of cloud engineers.\n\nI would suggest a multi-pronged approach where Eucalyptus gets specific types of load balancers as each one has been vetted; for example for doing straight HTTP balancing, Varnish is a very fast balancer that can be dynamically updated on it's Command Terminal port. The default method for doing this is varnishadm -T host:port vcl.load filename.vcl && varnishadm -T host:port vcl.use. the former will throw an error if the vcl file is unacceptable. This does not require using the caching features of Varnish at all, nor does changing the VCL in this fashion require loss of sessions or state.\n\nFor SSL, there's apache and nginx to terminate. All-around, nginx is probably going to be the most robust balancer (avoiding HAProxy for comparison, even though it is technically 'faster'). As far as TCP and SSLTCP i'm not experienced enough with FLOSS products to give any sort of recommendation there.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=genewitch","name":"genewitch","key":"genewitch","accountId":"557058:199151fc-c36a-4a36-9816-526c9f5aad91","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8b15abb66d6c58a35c2128acb75d0f5f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8b15abb66d6c58a35c2128acb75d0f5f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8b15abb66d6c58a35c2128acb75d0f5f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8b15abb66d6c58a35c2128acb75d0f5f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Van Rood","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-15T21:10:25.047-0600","updated":"2013-01-15T21:10:25.047-0600"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
