need an iptables rule to allow the SC to reach the mgmt port of the SAN. We experienced weird failures on the SC side, and looking into the logs, there seemed to be issue for the SC to talk to the SAN.\n\nFrom the command line we were able to reach reliably with a fast connection the SAN if we were using the IP address of the mgmt port directly, but it was extremely slow and with a lot of hung sessions if we were going to use the iptables stack. We did try to reload the iptables module, and to cleanrestart the CC, and although it seemed to help, it wouldn't last for more than few minutes. \n\nAvoiding the iptables stack was our workaround.
