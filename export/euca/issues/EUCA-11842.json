The instance got stopped but the CreateImage task never really kicked off. This means no snapshot creation happened at all. After looking at the state of the create image task in DB we found that it says {{stopping}}. The logs did not reveal anything in {{INFO}} mode.\r\n\r\nWe restarted CLC. The CLC restart tried to restore the CreateImage task but initially kept failing as SC was not ENABLED. I think it takes a bit of time before the CLC comes online for it to start talking to other services. Once the SC was enabled the logs did suggest that the CreateImage task was restored by the following log message:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n2015-12-16 03:35:10  INFO | Restoring create image task for i-33182715\r\n2015-12-16 03:35:10  INFO | craete image task for i-33182715 restored\r\n2015-12-16 03:35:10  INFO | Restoring create image task for i-b226ba01\r\n2015-12-16 03:35:10  INFO | craete image task for i-b226ba01 restored\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote there is a type in the word {{create}} as well. Now we checked again but no snapshot was kicked off. We weren't sure what was going on in the system when the first time {{CreateImage}} was executed by the customer.\r\n\r\nSo to get back to a state of re-trying we had to de-register the {{pending}} image twice, then go inside the DB and update the column regarding state information of create image task to {{failed}}. Then we started a new CreateImage task (the CreateImage task cannot be executed on an instance that has a pending CreateImage task already in). This time it worked like a charm.\r\n\r\nThere should be a way in the system to debug these problems and a way to get back to normal state so that the user can re-kick the job.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDeependra","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"CreateImage stuck in pending ","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"customfield_12100":"0|i03jzr:","customfield_10000":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":"2015-12-21T11:58:34.220-0600","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["dshekhawat(dshekhawat)","spark(spark)"],"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/40025/comment/97227","id":"97227","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"We hit this issue again today.

When the instance shuts down, the  'metadata_vm_guest_state' column of the 'metadata_instances' changes to 'poweredOff'. Throughout this step, the instance's external state remains as 'running'. The snapshot creation kicks off only after the column='poweredOff' to make sure the guest VM's filesystem is not corrupt. When the snapshot is created, the NC is notified to run the VM again and the field is updated to 'poweredOn'.\r\n\r\nSo I suspect there's some random failure in NC that shutdowns/power-on the VM. The successful NC operation will leave logs similar to this (ignore the ERROR log -- it's expected):\r\n2015-12-21 09:41:33  INFO | [i-64ed7001] instance shutdown requested\r\n2015-12-21 09:41:36 ERROR | libvirt: Domain not found: no domain with matching name 'i-64ed7001' (code=42)\r\n2015-12-21 09:41:38 ERROR | libvirt: Domain not found: no domain with matching name 'i-64ed7001' (code=42)\r\n2015-12-21 09:43:19 ERROR | libvirt: Domain not found: no domain with matching name 'i-64ed7001' (code=42)\r\n......\r\n2015-12-21 09:43:24  INFO | [i-64ed7001] instance start requested\r\n\r\nIf '--no-reboot' option is used with the create-image, this guest shutdown-powerOn step is skipped and there would be no failure (in-case that's ok with the customer for now). \r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=spark","name":"spark","key":"spark","accountId":"557058:2ed923b8-7172-41f0-a425-8796bd9a62f9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fec440044f6e652174838d59d9233f29?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dspark%26avatarId%3D10900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Sang-Min Park","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-21T11:58:34.220-0600","updated":"2015-12-21T11:58:34.220-0600"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-11842/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
