started up instance (with DISABLE_DNS=n), running hostname -f or dnsdomainname fails (causing issues with running Puppet, as, I would expect it would with other applications).\n\nAs a temporary workaround, I used a user-data script for cloud-init to put the following lines into /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf on the instance:\n\nsupersede domain-name \"eucalyptus.internal\"\nsupersede domain-search \"eucalyptus.internal\";\nprepend domain-name-servers 172.19.1.1; \n\n(I'm using the CLC private IP, because when using the public IP, the returning packets are from the local address, and dns doesn't like it.)\n\nI've been looking at a way to do this from the DHCP server on the CLC, and from what I can gather, I'd need to modify \"tools/eucanetd\" and possibly add some new options to eucalyptus.conf?\n\nCan anyone comment on if this is correct?\n\nAlso, would it be worth adding the ability to set/override dhcp server options from eucalyptus.conf?\n\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=eucabot","name":"eucabot","key":"eucabot","accountId":"557058:007ef05d-c772-4437-b383-d2b42d2a88a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/9e6d2b33ee28ce1387b2aa6cbe935cf3?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Deucabot%26avatarId%3D12000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Eucalyptus

the returning packets are from the local address, and dns doesn't like it.)\" .. \n\nThats a mix of two issues i think ..\n\nLets say your instance FQDN is euca-172-19-1-2.eucalyptus.internal / euca-10-2-2-110.eucalyptus.uec.domain.com (i.e in the admin GUI, you set the domain to be \"uec.domain.com\")\n\nYou have to delegate uec.domain.com to the CLC's public IP in domain.com's DNS records, and on you're local resolver, delagate \"internal\" to the CLC's public IP ... This is the only way I've managed to hack euca's DNS setup to work..\n\nThe second possible part of that issue is traffic returning from the wrong interface - thats hairpin NAT not being applied correctly.
