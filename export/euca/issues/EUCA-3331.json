The patch does not address upgrade code or python code yet (I have a separate two-line patch that statically changes the python rootwrap references for now), but covers all other components.  It allows standard configure options such as libexecdir, datarootdir, and sysconfdir, and passes values in CPPFLAGS, as recommended by the Gnu Autoconf documentation:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.69/html_node/Installation-Directory-Variables.html\r\n\r\nThis patch was written against 3.1.0, so it's already a bit outdated.  I'd like to get opinions on 1) whether the approach of this patch is acceptable to the team, and 2) whether it can be a candidate for a 3.1.x release, or should only be targeted at 3.2.
