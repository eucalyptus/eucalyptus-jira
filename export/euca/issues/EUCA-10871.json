Your instances do not require public IP addresses, and you do not need an Internet gateway, a NAT instance, or a virtual private gateway in your VPC. You use endpoint policies to control access to resources in other services. Traffic between your VPC and the AWS service does not leave the Amazon network.\r\n\r\nEndpoints are virtual devices. They do not rely on a physical piece of hardware; they impose no bandwidth restrictions, and are not a single point of failure. \r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-endpoint-for-amazon-s3/\r\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-endpoints.html","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"EC2 VPC endpoint support","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=sjones","name":"sjones","key":"sjones","accountId":"557058:f5dce1b0-db45-4dd6-a0e8-3cea5effb5ce","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/037fddf6d3bf6d691a448e01136f233a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsjones%26avatarId%3D18300%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Steve Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i038fr:","customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_13296332989_*|*_10001_*:*_1_*:*_51313627090","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["sjones(sjones)"],"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-10871/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
