This other account might be for certain power-users (but not cloud admins) in the same business group (i.e. Cloud IT) or maybe support personel.  For example, the cloud administrator would like users in this \"Tier 2 Support\" account to be able to run euca-describe-instances verbose and see instances across ALL accounts, not just their own, for support purposes.  On the other hand, they don't want them to have full eucalyptus/admin rights.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is something which can be enabled in the tooling but I expect it would be better if we could do this as some kind of extension to IAM perhaps.\r\n\r\nBased on this use case I've describe this as \"sudo\" accounts.  I think this works, we're looking for accounts which somehow sit between \"normal\" accounts and the \"eucalyptus\" account in terms of configurable elevated privileges.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-37","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"\"Sudo\" Accounts","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lwade","name":"lwade","key":"lwade","accountId":"557058:2fc477e4-c115-44ac-a23b-69acd1771151","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/beca0913accb99cac83a11f82082ef21?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlwade%26avatarId%3D11103%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lester Wade","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"customfield_12100":"0|i01e5b:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_155897851901","customfield_10001":"2012-10-02T11:32:34.311-0500","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":["Persona-PM"],"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_11600":["lwade(lwade)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/EUCA-2420/votes","votes":2,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
