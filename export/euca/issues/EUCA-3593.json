Download the Eucalyptus release key from http://www.eucalyptus.com/eucalyptus-cloud/security/keys\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAnd then add it using the following command:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\napt-key add c1240596-eucalyptus-release-key.pub\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis step is not required to be done for RPMS based distribution, it kills usability because the users are always in a \"confused\" state what key to download, how to download, where to download etc. In this case the actual file is http://www.eucalyptus.com/sites/all/files/c1240596-eucalyptus-release-key.pub but we do not mention it.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion we should not ask our user to do this step instead do that on their behalf when they install the release package.\r\n\r\nI see we do not have a release package for Eucalyptus, only Eucalyptus enterprise subscription.\r\n\r\nThis ticket is to improve the user experience during installation of Eucalyptus on Ubuntu and in future Debian.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are
