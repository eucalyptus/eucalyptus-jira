It does not attempt to use the same credentials as the\nauth handler that is being used for EC2 because we may be using STS\ncredentials for the latter.  S3 does not appear to support STS\ncredentials in POST upload policies.  Moreover, we cannot determine when\nSTS credentials will expire; if they were to expire while a bundle task\nis running the task will fail inexplicably.\n\nFixes TOOLS-478","files":[{"path":"euca2ools/commands/ec2/bundleinstance.py","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/euca2ools/commit/0e5965dfd0c14839a70f6e156288aef28f85a7c9#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":33,"linesRemoved":15}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
