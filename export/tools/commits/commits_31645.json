Strictly speaking, this commit just\njust sidesteps the problem for the one filter that has this problem\n(block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination) by changing its type to\nstr.  As the server handles all filter values with plain string\ncomparisons this is reasonable, and, in fact, should be expected for all\nfilters.\n\nIn case this comes up for regular args for some reason, however, this\ncommit also adds an arg type called flexible_bool that properly\ninterprets a variety of common strings for boolean values.\n\nFixes TOOLS-502","files":[{"path":"euca2ools/commands/argtypes.py","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/euca2ools/commit/d9f4f5fd50eeaf0955ff98a14e35dd3a10f6ed85#diff-0","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":8,"linesRemoved":0},{"path":"euca2ools/commands/euca/describeinstances.py","url":"https://github.com/eucalyptus/euca2ools/commit/d9f4f5fd50eeaf0955ff98a14e35dd3a10f6ed85#diff-1","changeType":"MODIFIED","linesAdded":1,"linesRemoved":1}]}]}],"_instance":{"singleInstance":true,"baseUrl":"https://github.com","name":"GitHub","typeName":"GitHub","id":"github","type":"github"}}]}
