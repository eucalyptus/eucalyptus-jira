To unbundle the image you need to provide the private key corresponding to either of those certificates.  If you chose to go without the user certificate then the only private key you can use for that is the cloud's.  See the description of euca-bundle-image's \\-c/\\-\\-cert option:\r\n\r\n{quote}\r\nA file containing your X.509 certificate.  If one is not available it will not be possible to unbundle the bundle without cloud administrator assistance.\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nThat aside, I suspect you're asking about this because of euca-bundle-instance because that does not allow one to supply a certificate.  AWS do this intentionally because it allows them to comply with Windows's licenses by making the images unusable outside of EC2.  Eucalyptus could potentially extend the BundleInstance operation with a way to provide a certificate, which would address your problem for users who do not share the same risk of license breaching.  See EUCA-7148.
