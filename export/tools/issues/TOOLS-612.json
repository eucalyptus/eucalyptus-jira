Each use specifies a new metric datum.  It is possible to use both in a single invocation.  To simplify scripting, using neither is not an error; the command exits without sending any data in that case.\r\n# The {{PutMetricData}} web service call accepts a maximum of 20 metric data per request.  When presented with more than 20, euwatch-put-data divides them into batches of no greater than 20 and submits each batch separately.  This will be visible in debug output.\r\n# The {{-s}} option accepts arbitrary attributes for metric data.  This allows one to report data for multiple metrics using a single call to the command.  For details on metric datum attributes and how to use this option, see the new {{euwatch-put-data(1)}} man page.\r\n# The {{-s}} option's long name changed to {{\\-\\-metric\\-datum}}, but its old names, {{\\-\\-statistic-values}} and {{\\-\\-statisticValues}}, both continue to work.  All four of these use the same code path because the new behavior is a strict superset of what existed previously.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-12-08T20:38:46.244-0600","updated":"2016-12-08T21:06:46.185-0600"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/TOOLS-612/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
