I spoke with Shashi about this at length in person and teased the two apart, and I will document our findings in this bug so future readers can reference it when they wonder the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion to synchronize euca2ools' version number with eucalyptus's is a result of a desire to preclude potential confusion or human error that may result from their divergence.  That is, while the main download page for euca2ools lists which versions are recommended for use with each version of eucalyptus, they are still installed separately, using separate steps, in eucalyptus's installation guide, leaving room for second-guesses or errors.  It follows that if the two versions were always the same this problem would go away.\r\n\r\nAs the earlier comments in this bug clearly indicate, the side effects of that course of action are legion.  It is simply impractical for us to attempt to keep projects' version numbers in lock-step when they are not always developed in lock-step.\r\n\r\nThat does not, however, mean it is impossible to maintain consistency among a collection of software projects.  In fact, eucalyptus already has such a collection:  its package repository.  Every eucalyptus series has a corresponding package repository with not only its own code, but also that of related projects, including dependencies and eucalyptus's very own web console.\r\n\r\nAfter one realizes that the goal here is simply to avoid the opportunity for people to accidentally mismatch eucalyptus and euca2ools versions, another solution becomes clear:  copy the version of euca2ools recommended for a given eucalyptus series into the latter's package repository.  This is essentially the same as what the user console and load balancer image already do.\r\n\r\nThe euca2ools project's version numbers will retain their independence.  My recommendation for the product management team is to explore this or a similar method of maintaining the software collection that surrounds the eucalyptus project without attempting to force synchronization of the projects' releases.  The technical work needed to do that is straightforward, involving updates to packaging and other release engineering scripts.  The key changes to scope are organizational in nature:  Eucalyptus Systems currently has precisely one software release process -- namely that for the eucalyptus project -- and that process is quite heavyweight.  Maintaining the software collection, whatever form it may take, requires more agility than this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-09T03:49:03.980-0600","updated":"2014-02-09T03:49:19.426-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/27175/comment/62707","id":"62707","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=shashi","name":"shashi","key":"shashi","accountId":"557058:cc7ee5dc-1d4f-46c5-8068-6ae350275ba6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Shashi Mysore","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"\"After one realizes that the goal here is simply to avoid the opportunity for people to accidentally mismatch eucalyptus and euca2ools versions, another solution becomes clear: copy the version of euca2ools recommended for a given eucalyptus series into the latter's package repository.
