Well, 3.2 introduced support for EMC, so no previous version will have the EMC adapter. Since the issue happens only if:\n\n- there are 2 or more NCs\n- AND the instance is bfEBS\n- AND a volume gets attached to such an instance\n\none could use EMC adapter for example if:\n\n- there is only one  NC\n- OR the instance is not bfEBS\n- OR no volumes gets attached\n\nThe single NC case is somewhat important for POC: if one wants to test the EMC adapter while they are waiting for 3.2.2, they could use one NC and test it out. So, I agree with you on the last sentence, but a blanket statement to not use 3.2 may be restrictive for the POC case.
