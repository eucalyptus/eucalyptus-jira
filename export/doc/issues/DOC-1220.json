So, yes, there is more than one CLI approach to this problem.

installations)\r\n\r\nIn both of those, you log into your vSphere endpoints (either vCenter or ESXi hosts) with username and password and you are presented with a management interface including \"inventory\" of hosts, datastores, VMs, networks, etc.  In the inventory of VMs, one should be able to visually find all VMs called 'emi-XXXX-YYYY' and remove each one from inventory using a menu
