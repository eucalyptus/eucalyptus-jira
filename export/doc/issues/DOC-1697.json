Note that the changes listed as unique to version 3.2.2 are backports of fixes previously released in version 3.3.0.  As usual, feel free to ask for clarification where needed.  In the event I need to update this list I will add comments that list the changes to make them easier to track.\r\n\r\nh4. Changes in euca2ools 3.2.2\r\n* A CloudFormation URL for the {{localhost}} region has been added.  (TOOLS-579)\r\n* Configuration for the retired Eucalyptus Community Cloud has been removed.\r\n* euwatch-get-stats --period's default value of 60 seconds is now sent to the server when the option is left unspecified.  (TOOLS-593)\r\n* euca-unbundle and euca-download-and-unbundle no longer consider bundles with certain checksums to be corrupt.  (TOOLS-594)\r\n\r\nh4. Changes in euca2ools 3.3.1 and 3.2.2\r\n* euca-authorize and euca-revoke now support 68-bit security group IDs.\r\n* euwatch-put-data now formats dimensions correctly when sending them to the server.  (TOOLS-597)\r\n* euca-describe-route-tables now supports the {{route.instance-id}} filter.  (TOOLS-616)\r\n* euca-describe-network-interfaces now displays attachment IDs when the server provides them.  (TOOLS-610)\r\n** Note that a portion of the fix for TOOLS-610 is delayed until the next minor release of euca2ools because it changes the command's output in a backwards-incompatible manner.\r\n* euca-describe-groups now supports the generic {{tag:_KEY_}} filter for tags.  (TOOLS-578)\r\n* The documentation for euca-upload-bundle's --part option, which previously had no effect, has been removed.  That option continues to be silently ignored.  (TOOLS-575)\r\n* euform-create-stack now returns an error when given tags with empty names.\r\n* euare-rolecreate's -f option now has a longer equivalent:  --trust-policy.  (TOOLS-603)\r\n* euca-fingerprint-key now returns an error when given a file that is not a private key.  (TOOLS-608)\r\n* euform-create-stack no longer sends a DisableRollback option unless it is explicitly requested.\r\n* euca-describe-network-interfaces now displays resource tags.  (TOOLS-621)\r\n* euform-update-stack now supports the --capabilities option.  (TOOLS-613)\r\n\r\nh4. Changes in euca2ools 3.3.1\r\n* {{euca-bundle-and-upload-image --debug}} no longer crashes when no signing certificate is available.\r\n* euca-bundle-image now supports the ppc64le architecture.\r\n* eulb-create-lb and now supports creating tags with a new --tag option.  (TOOLS-592)\r\n* euform-update-stack now supports updating and deleting tags with new --tag and --delete-tags options.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Euca2ools
