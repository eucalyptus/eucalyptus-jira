That process requires the vmware-brocker to be installed: I would argue that importing a VMWare image into Eucalyptus is not related to have a VMWareBroker at all, so, if possible at all I would like either:\n\n- to have an alternative way to download the image and convert it (ie using the GUI to dowload the image and to use qemu-img to convert it);\n\n- to have DOC explicitely mentioning the dependency on the vmwarebroker package;\n\n- to have euca_imager part of the default install.\n\nI'm sure there are other ways, but that's the ones I can think ok. 2 out of 3 are about Documentation: if you think repackaging is the best solution, feel free to move this ticket to EUCA.\n\nthanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=graziano","name":"graziano","key":"graziano","accountId":"557058:c440cc9e-8398-4f2e-8588-bdd59e3a7cf8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/b49ee573d77eef9bcd7fea74c1d591cf?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgraziano%26avatarId%3D10700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Graziano Obertelli","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-26T16:28:40.330-0500","updated":"2013-03-26T16:28:40.330-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/20209/comment/42301","id":"42301","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=awithrow","name":"awithrow","key":"awithrow","accountId":"557058:489310fd-31eb-49f8-8552-e87970faf51b","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Aaron Withrow","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Graziano, \n   You explanation helps.
