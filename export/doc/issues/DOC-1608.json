The list of changes is as follows.  If I make further changes to it I will note so with comments in this bug.\r\n\r\nh4. Changes in euca2ools 3.2.1 and euca2ools 3.1.3\r\n* Images created by euca-bundle-image and that contain block device mappings should now function correctly in EC2.  (TOOLS-559)\r\n* euare-accountgetsummary now accepts the --as-account option.  (TOOLS-554)\r\n* euca-authorize and euca-revoke can now create and delete rules with arbitrary [IANA-assigned protocol numbers|http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml] as well as the special values \"all\" and \"-1\", which refer to all network traffic, in VPC security groups.  As a convenience, if a protocol is specified by name euca-authorize and euca-revoke will consult /etc/protocols to discover its number.  (TOOLS-560)\r\n* euare-rolecreate --service is now read from the command line correctly.\r\n* EC2 no longer requires special privileges to use euca-register's and euca-install-image's --virtualization-type options.  Those commands' documentation now reflects that.\r\n* Account registration status will be removed from eucalyptus 4.2.  euare-usermod's documentation now reflects that.  (EUCA-9481)\r\n* euca-upload-bundle's --skipmanifest option now works correctly. (TOOLS-574)\r\n\r\nh4. Changes in euca2ools 3.2.1\r\n* This release includes a new euca2ools.ini man page, which documents euca2ools configuration files.\r\n* euare-accountcreate no longer requires an account name.  Note that account names are still required by eucalyptus 4.1 and earlier.  To add a name to an account that lacks one, use euare-accountaliascreate.  (TOOLS-557)\r\n* euca-describe-snapshots no longer sends requests that filter by snapshots' owners or restorers when asked to describe a list of specific snapshots.  (TOOLS-547)\r\n* euca-run-instances now accepts a --associate-public-ip-address option, which allows one to override the subnet's settings for whether or not new instances are assigned public IP addresses.
