Also, is this needed at all with 3.1? It doesn't appear so.\r\n\r\n- p35: \"Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\" not mentioned under \"Configure NTP.\"\r\n\r\n- p35: \"Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\" not mentioned in tip under \"Configure SELinux.\" Can that section also be skipped for 12.04?\r\n\r\n- p49: Step 9 states that eucalyptus-enterprise-vmware-broker should be in stalled on CC host (only), when in fact it must be installed on CC and CLC hosts.\r\n\r\n- p63/64: Under \"Verify the Startup,\" the VMware broker is listed as listening on port 8773, but it won't be listening there until after it has been configured and registered, which occurs in later sections.\r\n\r\n- p65: Under \"Register Walrus,\" I'm surmising the following sentence:\r\n\r\n\t\"The component name for Walrus has to be walrus.\"\r\n\tâ€¦should read:\r\n\t\"The partition name for Walrus has to be walrus.\"\r\n\r\n\tThis both makes more sense and matches the instructions under the \"Register the Secondary \tCloud Controller\" section.\r\n\r\n- p66: The instructions state to register the VMware Broker on the CLC host, but when the registration command is run on that host, it emits the following warning (and then appears to complete successfully):\r\n\r\n$ euca_conf --register-vmwarebroker --partition cc-juphoff --host 192.168.51.178 --component broker-178\r\nWarning: VMwareBroker registration must be peformed on the         VMwareBroker host.  Make sure you are running this         command on the VMwareBroker host.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, the VMware Broker must be installed on both the CLC host and the CC host.
