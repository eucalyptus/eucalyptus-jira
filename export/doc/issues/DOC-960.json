We have two properties so user can set one for all Linux images and another for Windows based images. Eucalyptus does not do anything based that string.\r\nWe just need to say that property exists and user can set type of the guest VM that Eucalyptus pass to vSphere as one of the parameters of VM create operation so vSphere can act somehow on it. I have no idea how vSphere uses this information.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=vasya","name":"vasya","key":"vasya","accountId":"557058:1c63481a-0634-4ae7-9004-cb0f143e141f","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/fa832ffa4e20c9aa05ac272214d43196?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dvasya%26avatarId%3D10408%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Vasiliy Kochergin","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-31T11:51:55.502-0600","updated":"2014-01-31T11:51:55.502-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/22802/comment/62329","id":"62329","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=scottb","name":"scottb","key":"scottb","accountId":"557058:8b784f3d-4aba-42f1-a016-d04e8269968b","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Scott Butler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~dmitrii] Can you please comment?

Let me explain its purpose: when one creates a VM, one is required to tell VMware what type of operating system you will be running inside. I don't know what the implications of different values are: as you noticed, there is not much documentation from VMware's side. It just seemed like something that users might want to change, so it became a property. Eucalyptus uses the most generic Linux VM and Windows VM values that we could find in the list of valid values (at the above link). So, I guess I would write something like this:\r\n\r\nbq. Properties vmwarebroker.vsphere_guest_os_id_linux and vmwarebroker.vsphere_guest_os_id_windows specify the guest OS type that Eucalyptus will assign to Linux and Windows instance VMs, respectively, when they are created on vSphere. Changing the property allows changing the type of guest OS that will be assigned to all Eucalyptus-provisioned VMs. By default, their vales are \"otherLinuxGuest\" for Linux EMIs and \"winNetStandard64Guest\" for Windows EMIs. Please, consult the VMware SDK documentation for the list of valid values for your version of vSphere.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-03T21:37:50.479-0600","updated":"2014-02-03T21:37:50.479-0600"}],"maxResults":12,"total":12,"startAt":0},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
