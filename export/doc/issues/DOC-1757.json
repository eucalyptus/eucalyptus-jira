I couldn't easily figure out what that step was asking me to do. \r\n\r\nNote that I'm currently modifying the original /etc/eucaconsole/nginx.conf and /etc/eucaconsole/console.ini versions to switch to custom SSL key/cert and turn on session.secure = true, as described partially in step 7a, and confirming that this works first.\r\n\r\nThen, I switch to an alternate separate Nginx configuration which supports both the console and UFS API endpoints using the separate /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and other files in that directory. \r\n\r\nSo, I'd like to see the embedded Nginx configuration started with eucaconsole kept separate as was the case in 4.2.0, so there's no conflict and I can continue to switch back an forth between these two configurations as desired by the client.\r\n\r\nInstructions on how I add the custom SSL config to the default embedded Nginx install are here: https://github.com/eucalyptus/euca-demo/blob/feature/4.2/installs/install-20-manual/docs/install-20-manual-install-hp-gol01-d6-public.md#configure-management-console-and-embedded-nginx-to-use-custom-ssl-certificates\r\n\r\nInstructions on how I replace the embedded Nginx proxy with my version which supports SSL termination of both the console and API endpoints with the UFS/MC hosts's single public IP are here: https://github.com/eucalyptus/euca-demo/blob/feature/4.2/installs/install-20-manual/docs/install-20-manual-install-hp-gol01-d6-public.md#replace-management-console-embedded-nginx-with-alternative-which-also-supports-ufs\r\n\r\nIt is extremely common to have both UFS and MC on the same host in POC environments, as well as a desire to protect both with SSL endpoints. The only way to do this is to have Nginx act as the proxy for both, as it owns port 443 when setup as the SSL proxy for the console.\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"4.2.1
