Withrow","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here's a paste of an email thread on the topic for additional info: \n\nHey Guys,\n\nAs <customer> works closer towards having a production ready product, one of the items they have to document is the complete list of ports and protocols in use by the underlying software (yeah for over controlled setups...)\n\nWe have the following section in the docs, but I do not believe it covers the full range of multicast ports or database connections but I could be wrong.\n\nCould someone please verify that if these were the only ports open between a fully distributed component installation (only focusing on Eucalyptus, not instance traffic), things would still work?\n\n(taken from the installation guide)\n\nTCP 8443   SSL port for the administrative web user interface. Configurable with euca-modify-property.\n\nTCP 8772   DEBUG ONLY: JMX port. This is disabled by default, and can be enabled with the --debug or --jmx options for CLOUD_OPTS.\n\nTCP 8773   Web services port for the CLC, Walrus, SC, and VB; also used for external and internal communications by the CLC and Walrus. Configurable with euca-modify-property.\n\nTCP 8774   Web services port on the CC. Configured in the eucalyptus.conf configuration file.\nTCP 8775   Web services port on the NC. Configured in the eucalyptus.conf configuration file.\nTCP 8776   Used by the image cacher on the CC. Configured in the eucalyptus.conf configuration file.\n\nTCP 8777    Database port on the CLC.\nTCP 8080    Port for the administrative web user interface. Forwards to 8443. Configurable with euca-modify-property.\n\nUDP 7500   Distributed cache port on the CLC, Walrus, SC, and VB.\nUDP 8773   HA membership port.\nTCP/UDP 53 DNS port on the CLC.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDarren\n\nNeil Soman\n7:01 PM (13 hours ago)\n\nto Vika, Darren, Daniel, Dmitrii, Ken, me, Harold, graziano \nCC'ing Vika. She has the most accurate info.\n\nVika, please see below.\n\n\nVika Felmetsger\n7:17 PM (13 hours ago)\n\nto Neil, Darren, Daniel, Dmitrii, Ken, me, Harold, graziano \nDarren,\n\nAs far as I know the only ports that are missing from that list are:\n\n- TCP 5005 for debugging (when --debug is used)\n- a random port (+ 2 randoms ports with --debug) that CLC, Walrus, VB, and SC open for detection of component failures (EUCA-3110). This should be mentioned in the Install Guide though. \n\nI went over open ports for all components shortly before 3.2.0 and if any other ports are missed, it's unintentional.\n\n\nDarren Stagnaro\n7:20 PM (13 hours ago)\n\nto Vika, Neil, Daniel, Dmitrii, Ken, me, Harold, graziano \nThanks Neil and Vika! This is awesome info.  I'll make note of TCP 5005.\n\nI notice 3110 is a bug.  I've gone ahead and marked it with a support label so we can track it, though I don't expect it to be a maintenance release type of fix. \n\nDo we have any idea of the port range that could be used for that random port(s)?\n\nThanks again guys,\n\nDarren\n\n\nVika Felmetsger\n7:24 PM (13 hours ago)\n\nto Darren, Neil, Daniel, Dmitrii, Ken, me, Harold, graziano \nThe random ports that I saw were in a pretty high range, like:\n\n39355/tcp open  unknown                                                                                                                                         \n44807/tcp open  unknown                                                                                                                                                  \n46921/tcp open  unknown   \n\nor \n\n39460/tcp open  unknown                                                                                                                                                  \n48242/tcp open  unknown                                                                                                                                                  \n59402/tcp open  unknown   \n\nBut I don't know if jgroups (which are at fault, I believe) give any guarantee on the actual range.\n\n\nDarren Stagnaro\n11:20 PM (9 hours ago)\n\nto Vika, Neil, Daniel, Dmitrii, Ken, me, Harold, graziano \nThanks Vika, great info.\n\nI assume this is for multicast configuration? If that is the case then I also assume we pre-configure the range as part of the jgroups configuration., so hopefully someone knows the range?  \n\nIt would be good if we could know/document the range rather than say \"random ports\" as that doesn't really help the customer too much.  :)\n\nThis is a great start so thank you so much for the good feedback.\n\n-Daren","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=awithrow","name":"awithrow","key":"awithrow","accountId":"557058:489310fd-31eb-49f8-8552-e87970faf51b","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Aaron Withrow","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-10T10:51:57.518-0600","updated":"2013-01-10T10:51:57.518-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/18502/comment/38411","id":"38411","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=awithrow","name":"awithrow","key":"awithrow","accountId":"557058:489310fd-31eb-49f8-8552-e87970faf51b","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Aaron Withrow","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"euca-3110 has some additional info on the random port number usage.
