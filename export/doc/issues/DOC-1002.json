We installed the CLC,Walrus,CC and SC on one\r\nmachine (Frontend) and installed NC on another machine and the third\r\nmachine was configured to be the eucalyptus client.\r\n\r\nThings are not always good.We have met a lot of problems during the\r\ninstallation and deployment process.The hardest thing is that the cloud is\r\nnot stable enough.Constantly, the node controller was found fail ,which\r\nresulted in the problem that we can't find the existing resources. for\r\nexample ,when we input the command:\r\neuca-describe-availability-zones verbose\r\n\r\nthe result is:\r\n\r\nAVAILABILITYZONE cluster01 192.168.1.101\r\narn:euca:eucalyptus:cluster01:cluster:cc-192.168.1.101/\r\nAVAILABILITYZONE |- vm types    free / max cpu ram disk\r\nAVAILABILITYZONE |- m1.small    0000 / 0000 1 128 2\r\nAVAILABILITYZONE |- c1.medium 0000 / 0000 1 256 5\r\nAVAILABILITYZONE |- m1.large     0000 / 0000 2 512 10\r\nAVAILABILITYZONE |- m1.xlarge   0000 / 0000 2 1024 20\r\nAVAILABILITYZONE |- c1.xlarge    0000 / 0000 4 2048 20\r\n\r\nAs you can see,there is no available resource we can use to start an\r\ninstance.Acctually,the machine where the node controller was installed is\r\nwealthy enough to run several instances.Once the node controller was going well and there were some available resources and we successfully start the linux instance.Then we stopped  NC and tried to make windows image and unfortunately when we finished it ,there is no available resource for us to start the windows image.To make matters worse?there is no nc.log file on the node now and we can't find the reason why the NC went wrong. This makes us feel upset.\r\n\r\nHere are some suggestions for you except the unstable problem:\r\n\r\n1. There are some unintelligible content of the operation manual.\r\n\r\n    For example,we had been confused for a long time when we made the\r\nwindows image according to the User Guide. We didn't get the real meaning\r\nof that part of the Guide book until we post a question on the official\r\nforum to ask for help. and finally one of the eucalyptus team members\r\nhelped us and we were told that there is a bug in the file.here is the\r\npage.\r\nhttps://engage.eucalyptus.com/customer/portal/questions/668036-install-eucalyptus-windows-integration\r\nThese uncertain content will make the new starter waste a lot of time.\r\n\r\n2. Can you please gather the normal problems that may appear during the\r\ninstallation and the deployment and the solutions  into a document ? This\r\nwill do a great favor to the beginners. for example,at first we tried to\r\ninstall Eucalyptus on the 32 bit linux OS and failed. I didn't  know why\r\nuntil I  found a message which was sent by one of the eucalyptus team\r\nmembers to other people.it said that Eucalyptus  must be installed on the\r\n62bit OS but there is no direction about this on the installation\r\nguide.Maybe there will be more beginners to meet the same problem.\r\n\r\n3. Can we get some details about the Eucalyptus except the 4 guide books to make a deep understand of the inner workings principle  of Eucalyptus  so that we can solve the problems we will meet  more easily. it seemed that NC is easier to be bad. for example ,Once I reinstalled the NC and started the NC service  ,but there was no log file for NC and I thought that I must\r\nfail to install NC but the eucalyptus team member told me the the log is\r\nonly generated after the CC successfully access the nc . Therefore? I think\r\nit?s good for us to know more about the inner working principle of\r\neucalyptus.\r\n------\r\nUser also needs:\r\n ------\r\n\"to make a automated migration tool on the basis of Eucalyptus. I wonder if Eucalyptus have provided users some tools for the pre-existing app's migration to the Eucalyptus private cloud? If we want to deploy our existing application on the cloud, should we only follow the below steps?firstly, start a windows or linux VM using the virtualization tools(kvm or xen); secondly ,log into the VM and deploy our app on the VM ; thirdly, upload the image you made to the Walrus; fourthly,launch your instance using the administrative command line interface or  the web-based user interface. Am I right? Is there any other methods ?  Can you please give me some suggestions about the automated migration tool ? Should I must be familiar with the Eucalyptus API?\"","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Faststart
