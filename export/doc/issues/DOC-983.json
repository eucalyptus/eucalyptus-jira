For instance, if you were to unpack the EVC into your home\r\ndirectory, you would need to run:\r\n\r\n    chmod o+x ~\r\n\r\nMore information is available [here](http://libvirt.org/drvqemu.html#securitydac).\r\n\r\n[robyn: Directory Permissions might be better listed below in the \"unpacking the EVC section\"; this is debatable, of course, since some people just like to straight up unpack everything the second they have their key in the computer. I remembered reading this part above, but it's possible that others might not. It might even be worth stepping people through the mkdir, the cd-ing, unpacking, chmod-ing of things; I'm not sure offhand if the files have to be unpacked first before doing the chmod, but that's useful to note if it is. I'm just a recurring idiot when I untar things and tend to do crap like making an additional nested folder and whatnot, so, again, just trying to make it easy.)\r\n\r\n## Enabling nested KVM in Fedora\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure KVM kernel modules are loaded:\r\n\r\n    modprobe kvm\r\n    modprobe kvm_intel\r\n\r\n[robyn: Might be useful to note what people should expect when typing this. Because (at least for me) nothing came back. Also: modprobe kvm_intel, and the details about checking for / enabling nested KVM, don't work if you don't have virtualization turned on in your bios. I was on a secondary (not my regular) laptop while doing this, and didn't realize that it wasn't on, and that gave me some heartburn for a bit; it seems that most Lenovo laptops have this disabled in the bios by default, so it might be worth mentioning.]\r\n\r\nOr if you're on an AMD system:\r\n\r\n    modprobe kvm\r\n    modprobe kvm_amd\r\n\r\nSecond, check if nested KVM is enabled:\r\n\r\n    cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested\r\n\r\nIf it returns 'Y' then you have nested KVM enabled!\r\n\r\nIf it returns 'N' then you need to enable nested KVM by running:\r\n\r\n    echo \"options kvm-intel nested=1\" > /etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel.conf\r\n\r\nOr if you have an AMD chip then replace **kvm-intel** with **kvm-amd**.\r\n\r\n## Unpacking the EVC\r\n\r\n    cd my/install/location\r\n    tar -zxvf evc-3.3.0-alpha-1.tar.gz\r\n    cd evc-3.3.0-alpha-1\r\n\r\n[robyn: \"Why isn't this tar thing working! Did I type the flags wrong? What's going on??? Oh, the filename in the instructions doesn't match the file on the pen.\" evc-alpha.tar.gz is what is on my pen. (However, the cd evc=3.3.0-alpha-1 is correct.) Also: Might be worth noting (since there's not a \"progress bar\" or anything) that the last bits of the un-tar process takes a long time, so people should not panic. And maybe useful to note how much space one needs.)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Running the EVC\r\n\r\nThe EVC must be run as the root user on your system and must be run from the\r\ndirectory where the EVC is unpacked.\r\n\r\n    sudo ./run-evc.sh\r\n\r\n## Shutting down the EVC\r\n\r\nYou can shut your EVC down like any other virtual machine. Once it is down, you\r\ncan remove the virtual network bridge by running:\r\n\r\n    sudo ./teardown-evc.sh\r\n\r\n## EVC Credentials\r\n\r\nOnce you've booted your EVC you can access services with the following credentials:\r\n\r\n* Demo User (for the EVC virtual machine itself):\r\n  + Login: demo\r\n  + Password: demo\r\n\r\n* Superuser (for the EVC virtual machine itself):\r\n  + Login: root\r\n  + Password: foobar\r\n\r\n* User Console Login:\r\n  + URL: https://192.168.42.2:8888\r\n  + Account: demo\r\n  + User: admin\r\n  + Password: foobar\r\n\r\n* Admin Console Login:\r\n  + URL: https://192.168.42.2:8443\r\n  + Account: eucalyptus\r\n  + User: admin\r\n  + Password: admin\r\n\r\n[robyn: There is an additional bit that spits out on the screen when you start the evc (after sudo ./run-evc.sh) - following the bits about logins/passwords that are identical to the lines above - that says - \r\n\r\nRun your VNC Client to log in...\r\nExample: vncviewer localhost::5902 \r\n\r\nThat part is not in the README.md]","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Fix EVC Documentation","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=smarvin","name":"smarvin","key":"smarvin","accountId":"557058:05586e44-7f70-416d-9933-1d102bb4cf60","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Scot Marvin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=smarvin","name":"smarvin","key":"smarvin","accountId":"557058:05586e44-7f70-416d-9933-1d102bb4cf60","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Scot Marvin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_10000":"1_*:*_1_*:*_24977805060_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_12100":"0|i028jj:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":"2013-08-22T10:40:21.139-0500","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["gregdek(gregdek)","smarvin(smarvin)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/23302/comment/51871","id":"51871","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gregdek","name":"gregdek","key":"gregdek","accountId":"557058:03f83db3-3217-4d33-ab46-1e156057c13d","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/152ea15ef67a66fe6a55c0ae34273f55?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/152ea15ef67a66fe6a55c0ae34273f55?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/152ea15ef67a66fe6a55c0ae34273f55?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/152ea15ef67a66fe6a55c0ae34273f55?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Greg DeKoenigsberg","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Note that this was *not* Faststart, but EVC.
