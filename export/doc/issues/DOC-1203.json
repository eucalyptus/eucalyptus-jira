I took ownership of this and flagged it for 4.0.0. Let me know when you think it's done-ish, and I'll put it into an XML table and include it in the docs. Initially, I think I'll include it as an appendix in the Install Guide--maybe link to it in the main doc landing page.

Should we allow for any version of RHEL/CentOS, or should we limit it somewhat, eg, nothing older than 5.0?

I have two reasons for this.\r\n\r\nFirst, we try to not specify versions of things when we can get away with it in the documentation--unless we can use a variable for it (we do this, for example, for both the current and previous versions of a product).\r\n\r\nSecond, each documentation release is version specific. So, it's a little odd to refer to a matrix with past versions in the current doc.\r\n\r\nI think we need this matrix, but outside the documentation set. I don't mind pulling in a subset of the information into each current documentation release. I think that's a good thing.\r\n\r\nWe don't have much time to design and write anything for 4.0.0--we're barely making our minimum feature set requirements. So, for 4.0.0, I'll concentrate on the matrix. However, we still need to figure out what our requirements are for 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n[~kristina@eucalyptus.com], do you have any recommendations about where this matrix should reside? I can link to it from the main documentation page. Should I just add it there?

I'll forward you an example via email to help provide some context.\r\n\r\nTo your points:\r\n\r\n1. I'm all for not specifying versions, for those things which are unlikely to be affected by versions. One exception which springs to mind is the recent version sensitivity of QEMU. The exposure left by not putting boundaries on what is supported is that we are implicitly obligated to support everything. By expressly saying \"this has been QA'd\" or \"this has been trivially tested\" or \"we've heard rumors that this works\" or similar will help to guide our customers down the right path, or at least help to avoid the wrong path.\r\n\r\n2. The matrix will probably need to live outside of the standard doc tree versioning. Or at least be loosely coupled, rather than strict. Otherwise we're back to the original challenge of helping customers who are running older versions of <thing> (most likely older versions of Eucalyptus itself) wanting to upgrade <other thing> (most likely the underlying OS) being able to find the older version of the docs on our website. For customers who are on what they feel is a stable version of Eucalyptus, but are interested in being on the latest version of RHEL/CentOS, I would expect them to eventually run into an issue after upgrading RHEL/CentOS to some version. Perhaps not today, but can we make that guarantee with RHEL 7.x? 8.x? If we learn (through a support ticket or QA testing or other vector) that a previously untested combination has been successfully tested, then the matrix can be updated accordingly. Another row or column added, or another version added to a table cell, etc.\r\n\r\nGiven the time crunch for 4.0.0, do what you need to do. This can wait a bit to be fleshed out.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jcarroll","name":"jcarroll","key":"jcarroll","accountId":"557058:20f8bca8-7023-4a30-9338-c10e76f7734e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d12e553a8592e80c9aa5e1ea19a1bde?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djcarroll%26avatarId%3D16000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d12e553a8592e80c9aa5e1ea19a1bde?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djcarroll%26avatarId%3D16000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d12e553a8592e80c9aa5e1ea19a1bde?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djcarroll%26avatarId%3D16000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d12e553a8592e80c9aa5e1ea19a1bde?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djcarroll%26avatarId%3D16000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jim Carroll","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2014-04-22T11:13:57.730-0500","updated":"2014-04-22T11:13:57.730-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/28608/comment/67711","id":"67711","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jcarroll","name":"jcarroll","key":"jcarroll","accountId":"557058:20f8bca8-7023-4a30-9338-c10e76f7734e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d12e553a8592e80c9aa5e1ea19a1bde?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djcarroll%26avatarId%3D16000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d12e553a8592e80c9aa5e1ea19a1bde?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djcarroll%26avatarId%3D16000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d12e553a8592e80c9aa5e1ea19a1bde?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djcarroll%26avatarId%3D16000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d12e553a8592e80c9aa5e1ea19a1bde?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djcarroll%26avatarId%3D16000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jim Carroll","active":true,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"body":"I really like this link:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.eucalyptus.com/eucalyptus-cloud/iaas/compatibility\r\n\r\nAs of this writing, it's focused on Eucalyptus 3.4.2.\r\n\r\nWhat isn't clear here is where someone who has 3.3.2 installed will go to get similar info.
