As more changes occur I will update this issue's description as needed.\r\n\r\nEuca2ools 3.2.3 is the last planned 3.2 release.\r\n\r\nh4. Changes in euca2ools 3.4.0, 3.3.2, and 3.2.3\r\n* A compatibility issue with Requests 2.11 has been addressed.\r\n* euca-modify-instance-attribute can now delete instances' user-data.  (TOOLS-647)\r\n* euca-import-instance now sends user-data to the server correctly.  (TOOLS-646)\r\n* euca-run-instances's --associate-public-ip-address option now works against default VPCs.  (TOOLS-639)\r\n* euform-validate-template now outputs capability reasons correctly.  (TOOLS-625)\r\n* {{euare-accountlistpolicies -v}} no longer fails when using credentials originating from euca2ools.ini files.  (TOOLS-651)\r\n* euca-bundle-vol now detects the type of partition table of the disk the root filesystem resides on significantly more reliably.\r\n* euca-bundle-vol no longer fails due to UUID conflicts when used on XFS filesystems.  (TOOLS-564)\r\n\r\nh4. Changes in euca2ools 3.4.0 and 3.3.2\r\n* euare-assumerole no longer generates invalid session names when run against AWS.  (TOOLS-655)\r\n* The configuration file for AWS now includes the us-east-2, ca-central-1, ap-south-1, and ap-northeast-2 regions.  (TOOLS-661, TOOLS-670)\r\n* When run against Eucalyptus, euca-bundle-vol now automatically retrieves cloud certificates in the same manner as euca-bundle-image.  (TOOLS-633)\r\n\r\nh4. Changes in euca2ools 3.4.0\r\n* Euca2ools 3.4.0 requires newer minimum versions of the following libraries:\r\n** requestbuilder 0.6\r\n** six 1.8\r\n* euca-describe-instance-type and euca-modify-instance-type now support VPC network interface limits.  (TOOLS-614)\r\n* euca-associate-address has a new --no-allow-reassociation option that explicitly prevents an address that is in use from being reassociated with another network interface.\r\n* euca-describe-instances now displays instance IDs as part of VPC network interface attachments.  (TOOLS-610)\r\n* It is now possible to view attributes of a CloudFormation template, such as its parameters, without creating a stack using the new euform-get-template-summary command.  (TOOLS-607)\r\n* It is now possible to create and manage VPC NAT gateways using the new euca-create-nat-gateway, euca-delete-nat-gateway, and euca-describe-nat-gateway commands.  (TOOLS-640, TOOLS-641, TOOLS-642)\r\n* euca-create-route and euca-describe-routes now support NAT gateways.  (TOOLS-643, TOOLS-644)\r\n* The new euare-getcallerid command makes it possible to request the ARN, account number, and other relevant information about the currently active set of access keys.\r\n* euform-update-stack no longer requires one to supply it with a template.  When no template is specified, the CloudFormation service will reuse the existing template.  (TOOLS-650)\r\n* Specifying a user name using the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION environment variables can break third party clients that do not recognize that syntax.  To work around this, use the new EUCA_DEFAULT_REGION environment variable instead.  When specified, this will take precedence over AWS_DEFAULT_REGION.  (TOOLS-604)\r\n* euscale-describe-launch-configs now includes user-data in the detailed output it displays when given the --show-long option.  (TOOLS-584)\r\n* euca-describe-subnets now supports the {{cidr}} and {{cidrBlock}} filters.  These function identically to the {{cidr-block}} filter that already existed.  (TOOLS-546)\r\n* The following new commands add support for managing OpenID Connect providers' integration with Eucalyptus and AWS (TOOLS-653):\r\n** euare-oidcprovideraddclientid\r\n** euare-oidcproviderchangethumbprint\r\n** euare-oidcprovidercreate\r\n** euare-oidcproviderdel\r\n** euare-oidcproviderdelclientid\r\n** euare-oidcprovidergetattribute\r\n** euare-oidcproviderlist\r\n* For CloudFormation template parameters with restrictions on allowed values, euform-get-template-summary now displays these allowed values.  (TOOLS-660)\r\n* It is now possible to retry a failed CloudFormation rollback operation using the new euform-continue-rollback command.  (TOOLS-637)\r\n* euca-describe-route-tables now prefers to display network interface IDs to instance IDs when displaying routes that point to instances' network interfaces.  (TOOLS-634)\r\n* The default configuration for euca-bundle-vol now excludes the following directories in addition to those it excluded in previous releases.  To customize this behavior, edit /etc/euca2ools/bundle-vol/excludes or use the {{--no-filter}} command line option.\r\n** /run\r\n** /tmp\r\n** /var/cache\r\n** /var/run\r\n** /var/tmp\r\n* euare commands that output euca2ools.ini files will replicate the {{verify-ssl}} option in its output if that option is set.  (TOOLS-631)\r\n* euca-bundle-image no longer fails with an authorization error when IAM policy prevents it from automatically retrieving cloud certificates.  This will not prevent euca-bundle-image from failing; to resolve the issue, obtain an IAM policy that permits the {{euserv:DescribeServiceCertificates}} operation or supply the cloud's certificate using the {{--ec2cert}} command line option or the {{cert}} region option in euca2ools.ini.  (TOOLS-630)\r\n* euwatch-put-data now supports reporting multiple metric data in a single invocation using the {{-v}} or {{-s}} options multiple times.  (TOOLS-612)\r\n* euwatch-put-data's {{-s}} option now accepts arbitrary attributes for metric data, making it possible to report data for multiple metrics or timestamps in a single invocation.  See the command's documentation for additional details.  The long name for {{-s}} is now {{\\-\\-metric-datum}}.  Its previous name, {{\\-\\-statistic-values}}, continues to function as it did in previous releases.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri

TOOLS-518 still affects all euca2ools releases.  Everything else looks great.  Thanks!\r\n\r\nHere is the second, and hopefully last, batch of changes:\r\n\r\nh5. Changes in euca2ools 3.4.0, 3.3.2, and 3.2.3\r\n* {{euare-accountlistpolicies -v}} no longer fails when using credentials originating from euca2ools.ini files.  (TOOLS-651)\r\n* euca-bundle-vol now detects the type of partition table of the disk the root filesystem resides on significantly more reliably.\r\n* euca-bundle-vol no longer fails due to UUID conflicts when used on XFS filesystems.  (TOOLS-564)\r\n\r\nh5. Changes in euca2ools 3.4.0 and 3.3.2\r\n* When run against Eucalyptus, euca-bundle-vol now automatically retrieves cloud certificates in the same manner as euca-bundle-image.  (TOOLS-633)\r\n* The configuration file for AWS now supports the ca-central-1 region.  (TOOLS-670)\r\n** Editor's note:  I recommend combining this with the release note for TOOLS-661.\r\n\r\nh5. Changes in euca2ools 3.4.0\r\n* Euca2ools 3.4.0 requires newer minimum versions of the following libraries:\r\n** requestbuilder 0.6\r\n** six 1.8\r\n* For CloudFormation template parameters with restrictions on allowed values, euform-get-template-summary now displays these allowed values.  (TOOLS-660)\r\n* It is now possible to retry a failed CloudFormation rollback operation using the new euform-continue-rollback command.  (TOOLS-637)\r\n* euca-describe-route-tables now prefers to display network interface IDs to instance IDs when displaying routes that point to instances' network interfaces.  (TOOLS-634)\r\n* The default configuration for euca-bundle-vol now excludes the following directories in addition to those it excluded in previous releases.  To customize this behavior, edit /etc/euca2ools/bundle-vol/excludes or use the {{--no-filter}} command line option.\r\n** /run\r\n** /tmp\r\n** /var/cache\r\n** /var/run\r\n** /var/tmp\r\n* euare commands that output euca2ools.ini files will replicate the {{verify-ssl}} option in its output if that option is set.  (TOOLS-631)\r\n* euca-bundle-image no longer fails with an authorization error when IAM policy prevents it from automatically retrieving cloud certificates.  This will not prevent euca-bundle-image from failing; to resolve the issue, obtain an IAM policy that permits the {{euserv:DescribeServiceCertificates}} operation or supply the cloud's certificate using the {{--ec2cert}} command line option or the {{cert}} region option in euca2ools.ini.  (TOOLS-630)\r\n* euwatch-put-data now supports reporting multiple metric data in a single invocation using the {{-v}} or {{-s}} options multiple times.  (TOOLS-612)\r\n* euwatch-put-data's {{-s}} option now accepts arbitrary attributes for metric data, making it possible to report data for multiple metrics or timestamps in a single invocation.  See the command's documentation for additional details.  The long name for {{-s}} is now {{\\-\\-metric-datum}}.
