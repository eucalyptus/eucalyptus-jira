This will need to be a case by case basis depending on the customer specifics.  Hence the reason why the customer will need to work with PS to complete the migration.  The only alternatives are for the customer to attempt this migration on their own (not recommended) or to perform a new install.

This is a philosophical issue with me: the documentation should note primarily what we do, not what we don't do. There are exceptions, and I'm open to them. However, release-sensitive information should be left to release notes.\n\nPerhaps this should have been an exception but then, after 3.2, we would need to delete the note because it's no longer an issue. So, that's part of the problem right there.\n\nThat said, we definitely should have said something in the release notes. The fact that we didn't is not acceptable. I'm sorry this slipped through the cracks. There was a note that went out to all clients, notifying them of this support, but we really need to include this in the release notes.
