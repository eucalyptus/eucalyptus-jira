The problem is that it conflates the concepts of normal users and account admins.   All page numbers below are from the PDF I downloaded on Sept 10.\r\n\r\nOn page 4 the guide says it is for users of the cloud, which I assume to be normal users of the cloud without administrative priveleges.   However, some sections of the guide are definitely for administrators and not users.  I will explain this below.\r\n\r\nOn page 5 it talks about signing up for an account.   An account is not something that a normal user signs up for.   When an account is created, the only user that is created is the admin of the account.  The admin user of each account is automatically given special administrative permissions for their account.  Those include, for example, the ability to create normal users in that account.  However, account admins are not normal cloud users which is what the guide is supposed to be written for.   The problem with this section is it never discusses how a user would get a normal user account.    The sections on downloading credentials and using euca2ools are correct, but in context would only apply to account administrators and not normal users.\r\n\r\nThe next three sections about Using Images, Using Instances, and Using EBS are largely true whether you are a normal user or an account admin.   The only glitch I saw in that section, pertaining to the issue of permissions, was on page 10.\r\n\r\nOn page 10 there is a error that is based on how things worked in Eucalyptus 2.   It states “Important:  Note that while all users can bundle, upload and register images, only the administrator has the\r\nrequired permissions to upload and register kernels and ramdisks.”   It is true that only admins can upload and register kernel and ramdisk images, but even normal users cannot bundle, upload, or register images until they are given an access control policy that allows them to do so.   This sentence is describing how it worked in Euca 2 before the introduction of IAM in Euca 3.\r\n\r\nThe next major problem is with the Using Access section.   This section pertains only to cloud and account admins, but not normal users.   Normal users should not be given permissions to create groups, users, or access control policies whereas account admins and the cloud admins have these permissions by default. For this reason this section should be in the Administrators guide and not the Users guide.\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-37","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"administrative-only
