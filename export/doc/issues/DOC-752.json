Plunkett","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ok, here's what I got, completely unformatted. [~kedwards], I would greatly appreciate a review to check that this is not technically bogus!\r\n\r\npartitioned.lock is a lock file that disables database updates in situations where connectivity problems in a high availability (HA) configuration could cause database corruption.\r\n\r\nIn a HA configuration, there are two machines capable of taking on the role of the cloud controller (CLC) component. At any time, only one should be in an ENABLED state: this is the machine currently serving as CLC. The other CLC should be in a DISABLED state.\r\n\r\nEach component stores information about its own state, and about the state of other components in the cloud. The components communicate their state and the expected state of other components over multicast IP.\r\n\r\nIn the case that the two CLCs lose connectivity with each other, other components should continue to communicate with each CLC. The CLCs will each evaluate the state of the group based on information from the other components. \r\n\r\nAs long as these components present a consistent view, the HA configuration will function as expected. That is, if the primary (ENABLED) CLC has failed, the DISABLED CLC will transition to being ENABLED. If the primary CLC has lost connectivity with the DISABLED CLC but has not failed, both CLCs will continue in their existing state, and try to re-establish connectivity.\r\n\r\nIf, however, another component communicates an inconsistent state to either CLC, that CLC will immediately create a partitioned.lock lock file, log a fault to the /var/log/eucalyptus/cloud-fault.log, and shut itself down, to ensure that the database is not corrupted because of this inconsistency. If the CLC that received this inconsistent state was previously the ENABLED CLC, the DISABLED CLC should automatically transition to ENABLED, and take over. \r\n\r\nNo CLC can be restarted while a partitioned.lock file is present, and it is recommended that you do not remove this file without understanding the failure that caused it to be created.\r\n\r\nMost commonly, this is a network error. To test multicast connectivity between two machines, run the following receiver command on the first machine (the machine running the primary CLC):\r\njava -classpath /usr/share/eucalyptus/jgroups-2.11.1.Final.jar\r\n org.jgroups.tests.McastReceiverTest -mcast_addr 224.10.10.10 -port 5555\r\n\r\nWhen that command blocks, run the following sender command on the second machine (the machine running the DISABLED CLC):\r\njava -classpath /usr/share/eucalyptus/jgroups-2.11.1.Final.jar\r\n org.jgroups.tests.McastSenderTest -mcast_addr 224.10.10.10 -port 5555\r\n\r\nThe two machines should be able to connect, and arbitrary lines entered on the sender should appear on the receiver.\r\n\r\nIf there is an ENABLED CLC running, and the machine that has shut down successfully connects to the machine running the ENABLED CLC using the multicast test above, you may remove the partitioned.lock file, and restart a CLC on that machine. If you continue to experience issues, we recommend contacting Eucalyptus support for further assistance.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=noirin","name":"noirin","key":"noirin","accountId":"557058:5be58e21-7229-47a3-a96a-befe39338f69","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8097d864e3191f12bf80a64ae723fe42?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dnoirin%26avatarId%3D12600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8097d864e3191f12bf80a64ae723fe42?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dnoirin%26avatarId%3D12600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8097d864e3191f12bf80a64ae723fe42?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dnoirin%26avatarId%3D12600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8097d864e3191f12bf80a64ae723fe42?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dnoirin%26avatarId%3D12600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Nóirín Plunkett","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-12T19:58:47.324-0500","updated":"2013-03-14T15:26:52.099-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/19649/comment/41478","id":"41478","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dstagnaro","name":"dstagnaro","key":"dstagnaro","accountId":"557058:ab9ac2db-0ce9-444b-b209-d57d16ac0e46","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/47244def11603caaf3cf61fc30c36997?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddstagnaro%26avatarId%3D11000%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Darren Stagnaro","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~noirin], just a quick comment, but in the 2nd paragraph, it suggests there could be more than 2 CLCs in a cloud setup.
