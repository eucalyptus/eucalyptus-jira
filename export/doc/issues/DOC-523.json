If people start to use our documentation, I think search would be more heavily used, so making it easier to access would be good\r\n\r\n2) I could not figure out what index is trying to do.

If yes, then it would be great to have tagging capabilities.  But those would require login and personalization features, which might be beyond Druple's capability.
