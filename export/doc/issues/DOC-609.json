But we should have a name for that. Then each section would offer an entire and complete installation narrative for that type of installation.\r\n\r\nThere is some concern for keeping granularity, or customized install guides. We can do with attributes too, even if we decide to merge the content in our XML.\r\n\r\nWhatever we do, I want to nail down a preliminary section for \"suggested installation for your needs\" type of thing, and then walk the reader through. I feel like we should do more hand-holding because this is complicated stuff and we're the ones who can best suggest what kind of installation they should try.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to figure out the presentation and format of this installation: one, big-ass guide, or two or three tailored guides?\r\n\r\nAnd that leads us to the other issue: what do we call this non-HA, non-POC install?\r\n\r\nFrom Steve:\r\n\r\n\"For customer simplicity I favor what you so eloquently called \"one big-ass\" guide.  I favor it because it provides the customer a one-stop shop for installation rather than initially trying to make them figure out which book they should choose to read.  They already have enough choices to make to install the product and we should not add to that load by making them choose the right book too.   By providing only a single book we eliminate that choice.  \r\n\r\nIt sounds easy enough to take a few pages at the beginning of the book to tell the reader that there are multiple installation methods described in the book.   If you provide some guidance as well about how to choose an installation method then the user can skip to the appropriate section.\r\n\r\nI also endorse your idea repeating information in the guide so that the reader does not have to skip around to do an installation.   Whatever you can do to simplify things is fantastic.   Repeating sections is more work for us (particularly during updates) but is easier for the customers.\r\n\r\nMy vote would be FastStart, Standard Installation, High Availability Installation, Upgrade, Nightly-Build Installation (and in that order).    Depending upon what the customer wants to test (function, stress test, architecture), a proof-of-concept installation could be done with FastStart, Standard Installation, or even High Availability Installation so I hate to call any method a proof-of-concept installation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Lester:\r\n\"I think this what we're leaning towards.  Keep everything in the one guide or uber-doc and then have a landing page at the beginning to send the user into these different install types. \r\n\r\nI double-agree with Scot re: repeating information; as long as we can make sure this is handled dynamically and we're not maintaining the same chunk in different places (I'm stating the obvious here.\"\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Merge
