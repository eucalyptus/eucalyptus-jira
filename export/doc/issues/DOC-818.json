This time I will be restarting components before upgrade and check on this issue again.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tony","name":"tony","key":"tony","accountId":"557058:353956db-b78c-4f3b-9096-f8f58e6709c8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tony Beckham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2013-03-19T13:44:08.045-0500","updated":"2013-03-19T13:44:08.045-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/20007/comment/42074","id":"42074","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=viglesias","name":"viglesias","key":"viglesias","accountId":"557058:49b276ff-ebf9-4dd6-ada3-b568a2898707","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/5608e0aa05bd6e5d73b855a08079cceb?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dviglesias%26avatarId%3D10405%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/5608e0aa05bd6e5d73b855a08079cceb?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dviglesias%26avatarId%3D10405%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/5608e0aa05bd6e5d73b855a08079cceb?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dviglesias%26avatarId%3D10405%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/5608e0aa05bd6e5d73b855a08079cceb?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dviglesias%26avatarId%3D10405%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Victor Iglesias","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"when [~hspencer] reproduced a similar symptom as the one in this bug it was due to a completely different code path, namely an issue with the HA databases syncing.

The important thing to note here is that with AWS S3, there are three levels of access controls. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n* AWS S3 IAM policy => policy to allow users to execute S3/Walrus actions\r\n* bucket policies => extension to the IAM policy to control access to buckets\r\n* bucket ACLs => ACLs to control which accounts have access to buckets.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found here:\r\n\r\n- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAuthAccess.html\r\n- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingIAMPolicies.html\r\n\r\nEucalyptus supports AWS S3 IAM policies and bucket ACLs. We currently do not support bucket policies. Additionally, any user under the eucalyptus account (i.e. the super admin account), bucket ACLs can't be utilized. This is a bug noted here: \r\n\r\n- https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-5512\r\n\r\nTherefore, if bucket ACLs need to be used, any non-eucalyptus account will need to be used. \r\n\r\nFor example, to implement bucket ACLs, the following steps can be followed:\r\n\r\n1) Source the credentials of the eucalyptus account/admin user.\r\n\r\n2) Create two accounts (e.g. accountA and accountB using euare-accountcreate)\r\n\r\n3) Create users under each account, creating keys for each user. To keep from downloading the credentials of the admin user of each account, use the --delegate option. (e.g. euare-usercreate --delegate accountA -u foo -k; euare-usercreate --delegate accountB -u bar -k) *NOTE* Make sure and note the access key and secret key that are displayed after each command)\r\n\r\n4) Create an AWS S3 IAM policy file to allow users to run S3/Walrus actions. The policy below is an example that you can use:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n \"Statement\": [\r\n    {\r\n        \"Sid\": \"Stmt1361565586161\",\r\n        \"Action\": \"s3:*\",\r\n        \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n        \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::*\"\r\n    }\r\n ]\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n5) After creating the policy file (lets call it s3-all-policy.txt), upload the policy for each user under each account. (e.g. euare-userupload-policy --delegate accountA -u foo -p s3-all-policy -f s3-all-policy.txt; euare-userupload-policy --delegate accountB -u bar -p s3-all-policy -f s3-all-policy.txt). Now you should be able to use any s3 tool to create, delete buckets and/or objects with easier user. \r\n\r\n6) To allow users from other accounts to access buckets, this is where bucket ACLs come into play. In AWS, when setting bucket ACLs, you use either the Canonical User ID or email address of the account of the user you want to allow access. In Eucalyptus, we use the Account ID. This is a known bug:\r\n\r\n- https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/browse/EUCA-5513\r\n\r\nTo add a bucket ACL, set up an S3 Tool that supports setting up bucket ACLs. s3cmd (https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd) is a tool that supports this. To set up an s3cmd config file to use with Eucalyptus, please refer to the following URL under the \"Configuration\" section. Please ignore the patch section. The latest version of s3cmd works with the latest version of Eucalyptus:\r\n\r\n- http://www.eucalyptus.com/eucalyptus-cloud/tools/s3cmd\r\n\r\n7) After setting up the configuration file, for example using the access key and secret key of user foo under accountA, use s3cmd to create a bucket - in this example, foobucket. (e.g. ./s3cmd/s3cmd --config=<config file for s3cmd> mb s3://foobucket). \r\n\r\n8) Make note of the account ID of accountB by listing the accounts (e.g. euare-accountlist). In this example, lets say the account ID of accountB is 807363558492. \r\n\r\n9) Use s3cmd to apply the appropriate bucket ACL. A list of the supported bucket ACLs can be found here: \r\n\r\n- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ACLOverview.html#permissions\r\n\r\nIn this example, lets apply the read ACL on bucket \"foobucket\", for any user under the accountB. To do so, run s3cmd using the credentials of user foo under accountA. (e.g. ./s3cmd/s3cmd --config=<config file for s3cmd> setacl --acl-grant read:807363558492 s3://foobucket). You can view the ACL with s3cmd as well (e.g. ./s3cmd/s3cmd --config=<config file for s3cmd> info s3://foobucket)\r\n\r\n10) After applying the ACL, create another config file for s3cmd using the credentials of user bar, under accountB. After creating the config file, you should be able to list the bucket \"foobucket\" using s3cmd. (e.g. e.g. ./s3cmd/s3cmd --config=<config file for s3cmd> la s3://foobucket)\r\n\r\nThats it. You should be good to go. Let us know if you have any issues. Below are some additional links to reference:\r\n\r\n- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ACLOverview.html\r\n- http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/3.2/cli/eiam.html#eiam\r\n\r\n=========================================================\r\n\r\nIs this information accurate?  If so, should be add this to our Eucalyptus Admin Guide?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any questions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nHarold Spencer,

Currently, there isn't any information in our guides that informs Cloud Admins what we support and what we don't with regards to S3 IAM policies and bucket ACLs.  This is something that - IMO - would go under the section that discusses access control with Eucalyptus Walrus (similar to what [AWS has for S3|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingAuthAccess.html]).  \r\n\r\nWhat specifically to document - I think [~zhill]'s explanation is spot on.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n1. Bucket ACLs - allow an account to explicity grant access to a bucket or object to another account. ACLs only work between accounts, not IAM users. You specify accounts via CanonicalID or the email address associated with the account (for Eucalyptus this is the email of the account admin).\r\n2.
