The owner of a file might be different from what it was on RHEL6.\r\n2. The file's SELinux security context might not be applied correctly on RHEL7, since we didn't support SELinux on RHEL6.\r\n\r\nHere's what we need to alert users to:\r\n\r\n1. The ownership of a restored file depends on how it was backed up to another machine over the network:\r\n* The \"tar -xvf\" Linux command sets the owner of each file it extracts to the same username and group name as the system on which it is being extracted. If those names exist, then the owner will be set appropriately, which will always be the case for Eucalyptus files. This is the recommended approach, except for large file sets that are too big to fit in a tar file.\r\n* The \"rsync\" Linux command saves the owner (e.g. \"eucalyptus:eucalyptus\") as its numeric user ID (UID) and group (ID) (e.g. \"498:498\"). When you \"rsync\" it back, it restores the UID and GID (e.g. \"498:498\"), regardless of the UID/GID of the same owner's username and group name. For example, \"eucalyptus:eucalyptus\" on RHEL7 on the upgraded host might have a UID and GID of \"994:991\". So, the file will no longer be owned by the eucalyptus user. * The \"scp -p\" Linux command preserves a file's modified time and its permission bits, but it does not preserve the owner. When you \"scp\" it back, the file may not have the same owner as the original file did. \r\n\r\nAny file whose owner is different from the file's owner on RHEL6 must be changed with a command such as \"chown eucalyptus:eucalyptus FILENAME\", or for a directory tree, \"chown -R eucalyptus:eucalyptus DIRNAME\".\r\n\r\n2. Because Eucalyptus on RHEL6 did not support SELinux, the SELinux security contexts of Eucalyptus-created files were not defined. When you restore a backed-up file to a directory on RHEL7 which is not its final directory destination (such as recovering a set of files from a backup machine over the network and then distributing them to their correct directories), the security context may not be correct. After moving such files to their correct directories, run the \"restorecon\" command on all such files. For example:\r\n{noformat}\r\nrestorecon /etc/eucalyptus/*.conf\r\n{noformat}\r\nIn contrast, if you restore a file from its backup machine directly to its correct destination directory, the SELinux security context will be applied correctly. Likewise, if you copy a tar backup file from a backup machine (e.g. eucalyptus-keydir.tgz) to any directory, and run the \"tar -xvf\" command to extract its files to the correct destination directory, the security context will be applied correctly.\r\n\r\nTo see the security context of a file, use the \"ls -Z\" command.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"DOC-2011","customfield_11500":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri
