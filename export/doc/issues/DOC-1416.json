We do not support upgrades from Walrus->RiakCS, so the normal 3.4.x -> 4.0.1 upgrade path will not require explicit configuration of objectstorage.providerclient.\r\n\r\nThus, if the admin does not want to use RiakCS, there are no additional configuration steps necessary for the OSG.\r\n\r\nSteps for upgrade from 3.4.x->4.0.1:\r\n#Run upgrade normally\r\n#Register UFS as needed for a normal 4.0.1 install, no need to run 'euca-modify-property -p objectstorage.providerclient=\"walrus\"' as there used to be in the 4.0.0 upgrade from 3.4.x\r\n\r\nIf the admin does want RiakCS, the steps are to set the value to 'riakcs' and restart the eucalyptus-cloud service on any OSG/UFS hosts. If none are running when the property is set then a restart is not necessary as they will pick up the proper value when started.\r\n\r\nFor configuring RiakCS on new installs:\r\n#Install euca\r\n#Start CLC as normal\r\n#Run 'euca-modify-property -p objectstorage.providerclient=\"riakcs\"'. It will say 'riakcs was walrus' to verify the value has changed\r\n#Restart any running eucalyptus-cloud services that have registered OSGs on them. This may be none yet if you have not yet registered UFS services/OSGs.

However, we need to make it clear that this is only for a 3.x->4.0.x+ upgrade. Specifically, the step for setting the backend provider (#2 on page 77) is no longer necessary as it will show it being set to ‘walrus’ automatically after a successful upgrade. We can replace that step with a verification step:\r\n\r\n“verify that the objectstorage.providerclient is set correctly to ‘walrus’: euca-describe-property -p objectstorage.providerclient’ should return  PROPERTY objectstorage.providerclient walrus\r\n\r\nPage 46 looks good to me.\r\n\r\nThanks Scott!\r\n\r\n\r\nZach Hill\r\nManager and Architect, Cloud Storage Software\r\nHP Cloud\r\n\r\n805.845.8000 x9309 (office) | zhill@hp.com | 6755 Hollister Ave | Suite 200 | Goleta | CA 93117 | USA\r\n\r\nFrom: Scott Butler <scottb@eucalyptus.com<mailto:scottb@eucalyptus.com>>\r\nDate: Saturday, January 31, 2015 at 7:25 PM\r\nTo: \"Tim Cramer (JIRA)\" <jira@eucalyptus.atlassian.net<mailto:jira@eucalyptus.atlassian.net>>, Zach Hill <zach@eucalyptus.com<mailto:zach@eucalyptus.com>>, Timothy Cramer <tjcramer@eucalyptus.com<mailto:tjcramer@eucalyptus.com>>\r\nSubject: Re: [JIRA] (DOC-1416) Update install procedures for 4.0.1 to reflect OSG config now that Walrus is default provider\r\n\r\nAccording to an email from Scot Marvin and my own digging around, it appears that this is correct in the install guide.\r\n\r\nZach, can you please verify?
