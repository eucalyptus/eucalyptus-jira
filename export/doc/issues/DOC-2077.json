This has numerous effects, which are outlined below.\r\n\r\n# Systemd now logs eucaconsole's output to the system's journal rather than {{/var/log/eucaconsole_startup.log}}.  To read this output, run {{journalctl -u eucaconsole.service}}.\r\n# {{/etc/sysconfig/eucaconsole}} has been removed.  To change the command line options with which the service runs, create an {{/etc/systemd/system/eucaconsole-memcached.service.d}} directory and add a file to it with your customizations as described in [section 9.6|https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/sect-Managing_Services_with_systemd-Unit_Files.html] of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 System Administrator Guide.\r\n# The memcached daemon that eucaconsole runs by default is now a separate service called {{eucaconsole-memcached.service}}, allowing it to be managed separately where necessary.  This service normally starts, stops, and restarts along with the main eucaconsole service.  The file that previously controlled the options passed to this service, {{/etc/eucaconsole/memcached}}, has been removed.  To disable this service entirely, run {{systemctl mask eucaconsole-memcached.service}}.  To change the command line options with which that service runs, create a {{/etc/systemd/system/eucaconsole-memcached.service.d}} directory and add a file to it with your customizations.\r\n# The nginx daemon that eucaconsole runs by default is now a separate service called {{eucaconsole-nginx.service}}, allowing it to be managed separately where necessary.  This service normally starts, stops, and restarts along with the main eucaconsole service.  The file that previously controlled the options passed to this service, {{/etc/sysconfig/eucaconsole}}, has been removed.  To disable this service entirely, run {{systemctl mask eucaconsole-nginx.service}}.  To change the command line options with which that service runs, create a {{/etc/systemd/system/eucaconsole-nginx.service.d}} directory and add a file to it with your customizations.\r\n\r\nA few changes are more relevant to developers than the typical user.\r\n\r\n# {{/usr/bin/eucaconsole}} is now included with eucaconsole source distributions and has been significantly simplified.  In general use it now accepts only one command line option, {{-c}}, which specifies an alternate location for its configuration file in situations where it should use a file other than {{/etc/eucaconsole/console.ini}}.  One typically does not run this program directly, instead using the system's service manager and the services named above for that.\r\n# Systemd-related files are now included with eucaconsole source distributions, but are not installed by default.  To install them, pass {{--init-system=systemd}} to {{setup.py install}}.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Eucaconsole 5 systemd changes","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri Meredith","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri Meredith","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_10000":null,"customfield_12100":"0|i042nr:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10004":null,"customfield_11600":["kmeredith(kmeredith)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/DOC-2077/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
