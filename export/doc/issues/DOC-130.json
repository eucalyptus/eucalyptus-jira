In the real world, the -r (--arch) option in the euca-bundle-image command defaults to x86_64. And the -a (--architecture) option in the euca-register command defaults to i386. Are these statements correct? I'm inferring that your note about the CLC was in reference to the euca-bundle-image command.\r\n\r\nAlso, does the -r (--arch) option in euca-bundle-vol default to x86_64 as well?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=smarvin","name":"smarvin","key":"smarvin","accountId":"557058:05586e44-7f70-416d-9933-1d102bb4cf60","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Scot Marvin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-05-16T15:30:10.726-0500","updated":"2012-05-16T15:30:10.726-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/11904/comment/27288","id":"27288","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yes, euca-register defaults to i386 when it should default to nothing, and RegisterImage on the CLC, _only for EBS images_, defaults to x86_64 when it should default to i386.\r\n\r\nSo you can figure out how best to explain the convolution of these, let's try explaining this exhaustively.\r\n\r\nAn instance-store image requires a bundle and a manifest.  You must supply an architecture when you run euca-bundle-image.  That architecture is written to the manifest file that you later upload to Walrus.  EBS images, however, have neither bundles nor manifests, so the server has an internal default as well.\r\n\r\nHere is the way things are supposed to work:\r\n\r\n# instance-store, arch passed to euca-register\r\n#* euca-register sends the architecture which was passed to it to the server.\r\n#* The server uses the architecture which was passed to euca-register.\r\n# instance-store, arch not passed to euca-register\r\n#* euca-register does not send an architecture to the server.\r\n#* The server uses the architecture given in the manifest.\r\n# EBS, arch passed to euca-register\r\n#* euca-register sends the architecture which was passed to it to the server.\r\n#* The server uses the architecture which was passed to euca-register.\r\n# EBS, arch not passed to euca-register\r\n#* euca-register does not send an architecture to the server.\r\n#* The server uses \"i386\" for the architecture.\r\n\r\nHere is the way things actually work:\r\n\r\n# instance-store, arch passed to euca-register\r\n#* euca-register sends the architecture which was passed to it to the server.\r\n#* The server uses the architecture which was passed to euca-register.\r\n# instance-store, arch not passed to euca-register\r\n#* euca-register {color:red}sends \"i386\"{color} to the server because its default is \"i386\" and not nothing.\r\n#* The server {color:red}uses \"i386\" for the architecture and ignores the value in the manifest{color}.\r\n# EBS, arch passed to euca-register\r\n#* euca-register sends the architecture which was passed to it to the server.\r\n#* The server uses the architecture which was passed to euca-register.\r\n# EBS, arch not passed to euca-register\r\n#* euca-register {color:red}sends \"i386\"{color} to the server because its default is \"i386\" and not nothing.\r\n#* The server uses \"i386\" for the architecture, though only because it was explicitly instructed to do so.\r\n\r\nHere is the way things work when the euca-register bug is fixed, but the CLC bug is not:\r\n\r\n# instance-store, arch passed to euca-register\r\n#* euca-register sends the architecture which was passed to it to the server.\r\n#* The server uses the architecture which
