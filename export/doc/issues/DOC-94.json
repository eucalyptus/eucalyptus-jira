another distro, so putting it in package logic for a single distro is not sufficient.  \n  \n* the file cannot be owned by the package, because the package cannot know the user's home directory until install time. (It could be added in the post script, though, if not for my other paranoid reasons)  \n  \n* if somehow the user's home directory were changed outside of the rpm install process, a new file needs to be created  \n  \n* if the file is ever removed by someone, it may need to be recreated (unlikely, but possible)  \n  \nand it was a simple enough change to make in the NC, so I don't see any issue\nwith having it there.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=agrimm","name":"agrimm","key":"agrimm","accountId":"557058:9ebc3512-73d8-45c9-85de-4325aaa62488","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Andy Grimm","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2012-04-23T20:32:27.211-0500","updated":"2012-04-23T20:32:27.211-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/11651/comment/19528","id":"19528","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=agrimm","name":"agrimm","key":"agrimm","accountId":"557058:9ebc3512-73d8-45c9-85de-4325aaa62488","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/0e947b5413f5d57fba29a8ea5412f773?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dagrimm%26avatarId%3D10500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Andy Grimm","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Originally posted on 2011-12-19 20:30:12\n  \nI missed an important detail here.
