Thus this was resolved in 3.2.1.   The fix for allowing SAN devices to use hostnames (EUCA-5463) occurred for 3.3.\r\n\r\nWhen using a hostname it will internally resolve and use the IP.  However, the address cannot be a: (1) site local, (2) any-cast, (3) loopback, (4) link local, or (5) multicast address \r\n\r\nIn addition, one may only use hostnames for convenience when registering components, but may not subsequently change the underlying IP associated with a hostname.  Doing so will cause erratic/undefined behavior.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tjcramer","name":"tjcramer","key":"tjcramer","accountId":"557058:e076cf45-80ca-4b67-befb-7b0c21f32739","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tim Cramer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-21T22:53:01.061-0500","updated":"2013-03-21T22:53:28.982-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/20088/comment/46143","id":"46143","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=scottb","name":"scottb","key":"scottb","accountId":"557058:8b784f3d-4aba-42f1-a016-d04e8269968b","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Scott Butler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Added the following note to the 'Registering Eucalyptus' anchor topic:\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: We recommend that you use IP addresses rather than host names when registering Eucalyptus components.
