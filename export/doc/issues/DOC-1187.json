Right now, we are testing / supporting Walrus and RiakCS as storage providers. The benefit of having the OSG sit between Eucalyptus and the storage provider is that storage providers will each have their own minor behavior differences. One of these differences is that RiakCS does not support the \"PUT Object - Copy\" operation as described here - \r\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectCOPY.html\r\nTo work around this issue, we introduced the ability for the OSG to manually create a copy of an object. Unfortunately, manually copying large objects can be slow and memory-intensive because the OSG will first attempt to GET the source object, then it will PUT the results into the destination. Rather than having the system always attempt to manually copy objects, this capability is turned off by default. However, an administrator can turn the functionality on by enabling the property like so - \r\neuca-modify-property -p objectstorage.dogetputoncopyfail=true\r\nWith this property enabled, the OSG will attempt to perform a manual copy (GET source, followed by PUT on destination) whenever the copy operation fails against the upstream provider.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"properly
