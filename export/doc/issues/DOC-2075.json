Certainly, the Eucalyptus \"component\" NC does not host VMs (it is the responsibility of the system hypervisor) and/or directly manages/controls VMs (it is done through libvirt) - as the diagram may suggest.\r\nFor the grey boxes, we have \"User Services\", \"Backend Services\", and ??? \"Availability Zone\" ??? Is Availability Zone a collection of Services (as User and Backend)?\r\n\r\nThe confusion is clear in the ticket description: \"rather it's a service as it runs on CLC and/or NC\" - in this case CLC and NC is referring to the physical server running Eucalyptus software and configured to act as CLC and/or NC, but the diagram/section is about Eucalyptus components/services and referring CLC and NC as the Eucalyptus component/service. So, is CLC a physical server, an Eucalyptus component, an Eucalyptus service, or all the above?\r\n\r\nGiven the Webster definition of component being \"a constituent part\", I have a hard time agreeing that   \"eucanetd is *not* a component (of Eucalyptus)\".\r\n\r\nChanging \"component\" to \"service\" is ok if the term \"service\" is clearly defined somewhere. It is an overloaded term.\r\n\r\nLeaving the precise correctness of the diagram aside, I believe that the diagram does transmit the high-level view of Eucalyptus to readers.\r\n\r\nOne way to (partially) address the concerns could be to have a figure caption explaining the diagram - including what are the grey boxes? What do the different colors (grey, blue, green, and orange) represents?\r\n\r\nIt would be best to collect opinion/view from all Eucalyptus team (since there will be disagreements), and most importantly from actual readers.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tsugawa","name":"tsugawa","key":"tsugawa","accountId":"557058:619bab88-9b87-4778-995a-1e8a85d8b899","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c16b1da4b6426cad544b6eddd78d76b1?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c16b1da4b6426cad544b6eddd78d76b1?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c16b1da4b6426cad544b6eddd78d76b1?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c16b1da4b6426cad544b6eddd78d76b1?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"M Tsugawa","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2017-02-10T09:16:08.512-0600","updated":"2017-02-10T09:16:08.512-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/54605/comment/117503","id":"117503","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri Meredith","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thank you [~shaon] and [~tsugawa] for your input.
