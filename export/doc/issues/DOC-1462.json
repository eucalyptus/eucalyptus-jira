I am not sure where this goes in the documentation or what level of granularity you want, so feel free to copypaste and summarize this information to your heart's desire.\r\n\r\nh3. Changes in euca2ools 3.0.4\r\n\r\nTOOLS-447:  HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY are now handled correctly for commands that begin with \"euca.\"  Version 0.1.1 of the requestbuilder library, which ships alongside euca2ools 3.0.4, fixes them for other commands.\r\n\r\nh3. Changes in euca2ools 3.1.1\r\n\r\nTOOLS-447:  Version 0.2.2 of the requestbuilder library ships alongside euca2ools 3.1.1, making {{HTTP_PROXY}} and {{HTTPS_PROXY}} work correctly.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-478:  euca-bundle-instance now attempts to obtain access key IDs and secret keys from configuration files when they are not specified at the command line.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-482:  euare-instanceprofiledel \\-r/\\--recursive now attempts to delete any roles that are associated with the instance profile that is being deleted.  If other resources, such as other instance profiles, prevent a role from being deleted then the command will fail.  Running euare-roledel \\-r/\\--recursive can overcome this.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-488:  euca-import-instance now encodes user-data correctly.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-489:  euca-describe-instances now shows instances' architectures.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-491:  euca-import-instance and euca-import-volume now provide more useful error output when bucket creation fails.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-495:  euca-run-instances now handles user-supplied private addresses correctly.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-496:  euca-describe-instances now accepts an \"iam-instance-profile.arn\" filter.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-497:  For consistency with euca-create-vpc, euca-create-subnet will work correctly when address ranges are specified positionally.  The \\-i/\\--cidr option is still recommended and continues to work.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-498:  euca-describe-subnets now shows subnets' address ranges.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-503:  For compatibility with its AWS-provided counterpart, euform-create-stack's and euform-update-stack's \\-p/\\--parameter option now allows one to supply more than one parameter with a single option by separating the parameters with semicolons.  When it is used multiple times, the option still works as before.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-510:  euca-modify-instance-attribute \\-t/\\--instance-type now works correctly.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-512:  euform-describe-stacks now lists stacks' outputs.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-519:  euca-bundle-vol now works correctly on RHEL 6 and CentOS 6 instances.\r\n\r\neuscale-create-launch-config now allows one to specify whether the service will associate public addresses with VPC instances created by a launch configuration.  Use \"\\--associate-public-ip-address true\" or \"\\--associate-public-ip-address false\" to control this.\r\n\r\nh3. Changes common to euca2ools 3.0.4 and 3.1.1\r\n\r\nTOOLS-486:  euare-userdelcert and euare-userdelkey no longer require \\-u/\\--user.  When that option is omitted they will act upon the user that the command is running as.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-490:  euca-describe-instances's \"block-device-mapping.delete-on-termination\" filter now passes its inputs to the server using lowercase.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-494:  euca-describe-snapshot-attribute and euca-reset-snapshot-attribute were missing from previous releases.  This has been fixed.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-500:  euca-describe-groups now accepts an \"ip-permission.group-id\" filter.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-501:  euca-authorize's \\-s/\\--cidr option now works with the \\--egress option.\r\n\r\nTOOLS-513:  euare-usercreatecert no longer requires \\-u/\\--user.  When that option is omitted it will act upon the user that the command is running as.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Release
