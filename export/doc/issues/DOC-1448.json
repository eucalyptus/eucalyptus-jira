(http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/configuring_bridge.html)\r\nIt may be helpful to be explicit on the 2 modes that require bridge configuration: MANAGED NO-VLAN and EDGE. Currently we have “For Managed (No VLAN) and EDGE modes” and it may not be clear that MANAGED mode does not require it.\r\nVPCMIDO mode does require bridge on all NCs, but the configuration is slightly different compared to the other modes – i.e., there is no need to attach a physical NIC to the bridge (perhaps Matt Bacchi could provide information on how it is done on QA system)\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri Meredith","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-07-13T18:05:11.127-0500","updated":"2016-07-13T18:05:11.127-0500"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/DOC-1448/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
