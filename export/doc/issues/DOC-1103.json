After discussing this with [~dmitrii], we should be referencing [euca-bundle-vol|http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/eucalyptus/3.4/index.html#euca2ools-guide/euca-bundle-vol.html] primarily to be more inline with AWS documentation regarding [\"Creating an Instance Store-Backed AMI From an Existing AMI\"|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-snapshot-s3-linux.html].\r\n\r\n*Suggested Update*\r\n\r\nSuggestion is to update the section to mimic what [AWS has for documentation|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-snapshot-s3-linux.html]. Example below:\r\n\r\nh2.  Create a New Image from an Existing Instance-Store Image\r\n\r\nh3. Before You Get Started\r\n\r\n* Make sure the latest version of euca2ools has been installed in the instance.  For additional information regarding installing euca2ools, please refer to the [Euca2ools documentation|http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/eucalyptus/3.4/index.html#shared/installing_euca2ools.html].\r\n* Formatted space (either ephemeral, or an attached EBS volume) that will contain bundled EMI.\r\n* Make sure [kernel|http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/eucalyptus/3.4/index.html#shared/add_kernel.html] and [ramdisk|http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/eucalyptus/3.4/index.html#shared/add_ramdisk.html] are bundled, uploaded and registered. *NOTE* Kernel and ramdisk can only be registered by cloud administrators.\r\n\r\nh4. Tasks to Use an Existing EMI to Create a New EMI\r\n\r\n* Prepare the instance \r\n* Upload the Key and Certificate\r\n* Bundle the Customized Image (Requires Root Privileges)\r\n* Upload the Bundled EMI\r\n* Register the EMI\r\n\r\nh4.  Prepare the instance\r\n\r\nFollow the steps mentioned in the section [\"Prepare a Linux Image for Eucalyptus\"|http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/eucalyptus/3.4/index.html#image-guide/ig_task_prepare_image.html] to prepare the instance.  \r\n\r\nh4.  Upload the Key and Certificate\r\n\r\nYour new EMI must be encrypted and signed to ensure that only you and Eucalyptus can access it. To accomplish this, you must upload your Eucalyptus EC2 private key and X.509 certificate to an instance store directory on your running instance. The private key and the certificate will be used in the EMI bundling process.\r\n\r\nThe private key and certificate files must not be bundled with the image. To prevent this, create a separate directory for these files. This directory will be specifically excluded from the bundle. In these examples, the private key and certificate files will be stored in the /tmp/cert directory. You can either use a secure file transfer program such as [scp|http://linux.die.net/man/1/scp] to copy the files from your computer to your instance, or you can upload them directly. You must grant write permissions to the directory where these files will be uploaded. The following command grants write permission to /tmp/cert.\r\n{code}\r\n# sudo chmod 777 /tmp/cert\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. Upload your Eucalyptus EC2 private key and X.509 certificate\r\n\r\nCopy your Eucalyptus EC2 private key and X.509 certificate to the instance using a secure copy tool like [scp|http://linux.die.net/man/1/scp].\r\n\r\nThe following example shows how to use the scp command:\r\n{code}\r\n# scp -i <keypair_name> <private_keyfile> <certificate_file> <cloud_certificate_file> <username>@<dns_location>:<instance_store_directory>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhere,\r\n\r\n* <keypair_name> is the .pem file.\r\n* <private_keyfile> is the file that contains the private key.\r\n* <certificate_file> is the file that contains the certificate.\r\n* <cloud_certificate_file> is the file that contains the cloud certificate\r\n* <username> is the login name you use to log in to your instance; for example, ec2-user.\r\n* <dns_location> is the DNS location of the instance within Eucalyptus.\r\n* <instance_store_directory> is the directory where your instance store is mounted.\r\n\r\nscp displays the names of the files copied and some performance statistics.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of a fully specified scp command using the CentOS 6 Linux EMI:\r\n{code}\r\n# scp -i admin-creds/euca-admin.priv euca2-admin-00f194d4-cert.pem euca2-admin-00f194d4-pk.pem cloud-cert.pem ec2-user@euca-10-104-7-11.eucalyptus.acme.eucalyptus-systems.com:/tmp/cert/.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4. Bundle the Customized Image (Requires Root Privileges)\r\n\r\nWhen you have the image that meets your specifications, you need to bundle it for uploading to Eucalyptus Walrus. The bundling process requires both the euca2ools and root privileges. Root privileges can be obtained with the sudo su or sudo su- command:\r\n{code}\r\n# sudo su -[root password]\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh5. To bundle the customized image\r\n\r\nUse euca-bundle-vol command to create the image.  Make sure to exclude the directory where the private key and certificate files are stored with the _-e_ option. This option excludes files that may contain sensitive information, such as your Eucalyptus credentials. By default, the bundle process excludes files that might contain sensitive information. These files include _\\*.sw_, _\\*.swo_, _\\*.swp_, _\\*.pem_, _\\*.priv_, _\\*id_rsa\\*_, _\\*id_dsa\\*_, _\\*.gpg_, _\\*.jks_, _\\*/.ssh/authorized_keys_, and _\\*/.bash_history_. To include all of these files, use the --no-filter option. To include some of these files, use the --include option.\r\n{code}\r\n# euca-bundle-vol -k <private_keyfile> -c <certificate_file> -u <your_aws_account_id> --ec2cert <cloud_certificate_file> -e <cert_location>,<directory_containing_bundled_image>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n* <private_keyfile> is the file that contains the private key.\r\n* <certificate_file> is the file that contains the certificate.\r\n* <cloud_certificate_file> is the file that contains the cloud certificate.\r\n* <user_id> is the ID associated with your AWS account. This is your Eucalyptus account ID without dashes. It consists of 12 to 15 characters, and it's not the same as your access key ID.\r\n* <cert_location> is the directory that contains the private key and certificate files, which must be excluded from the bundle.\r\n* <directory_containing_bundled_image> is the directory where the bundled image will be placed (--destination option)\r\n\r\n*Note*\r\nIf SELinux is enabled on your system, be sure to disable it before running *euca-bundle-vol*.\r\n\r\nExecute the following command to bundle the local machine root filesystem:\r\n{code}\r\n# euca-bundle-vol -e /tmp/cert -e /tmp,/mnt/image -d /mnt/image \r\n-r x86_64\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh4. Upload a Bundled EMI\r\n\r\nThe bundled EMI must be uploaded to Eucalyptus Walrus before Eucalyptus can access it.  This task is necessary when you create Eucalyptus instance store-backed EMIs from an existing instance or from a loopback. Use the euca-upload-bundle command to upload the bundled EMI that you created earlier. Eucalyptus Walrus stores data objects in buckets, which are similar to directories. All buckets must have globally unique names. The euca-upload-bundle command uploads the bundled EMI to a specified bucket. If the specified bucket exists and belongs to another Eucalyptus account, the euca-upload-bundle command will fail.\r\n\r\nh5. To upload the bundled EMI\r\n\r\nUse euca-upload-bundle command as follows:\r\n{code}\r\n# euca-upload-bundle -b <your-walrus-bucket> -m <manifest_path> -a <access_key> -s <secret_key>\r\n{code}\r\n<your-s3-bucket> is the Amazon S3 bucket that the bundle will be uploaded to. You can also upload the bundle to a subfolder of the bucket, such as my-awsbucket/uploaded-images/image-1. If the subfolder does not exist, it will be created.\r\n\r\n* <manifest_path> is the full path to the manifest file (for example, /tmp/image.manifest.xml). The manifest file will reside in the destination directory that was specified in the euca-bundle-vol command.\r\n* <access_key> is your Eucalyptus access key ID.\r\n* <secret_key> is your Eucalyptus secret key.\r\n\r\nThe EMI manifest file and all image parts are uploaded to Eucalyptus Walrus. The manifest file is encrypted with the Eucalyptus public key before being uploaded.\r\n\r\nh4.  Register the EMI\r\n\r\nYou must register your image with Eucalyptus, so that Eucalyptus can locate it and run instances based on it. This task is necessary when you create Eucalyptus instance store-backed EMIs from an existing file or from a loopback. If you make any changes to the source image stored in Eucalyptus Walrus, you must reregister the image.\r\n\r\nh5.  To register the EMI that you created and uploaded to Eucalyptus Walrus\r\n\r\nUse the euca-register command as follows:\r\n{code}\r\n# euca-register <your-walrus-bucket>/<path>/<image-name>.manifest.xml -n <image_name> -O <your_access_key> -W <your_secret_key>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nEucalyptus returns the EMI identifier once the command completes successfully.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"euca-bundle-vol
