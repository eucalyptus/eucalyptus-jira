Do we keep tech preview in the future?\r\n\r\nYes, we want to keep the option of using it in the future. It is reserved for features that are not present in their entirety (MVP), but are nevertheless partially usable in a release (but without any promises of upgradability, etc). So, please, keep the definition of what we mean by Tech Preview in the docs – it looks reasonable — even if there is no feature that has that designation in a release. In that case, just state that “There are no features in Tech Preview in this release” or something to that end.\r\n\r\n2.       What features are currently tech preview? (so far in 4.2, I’m not aware of any that will remain on the list)\r\n\r\nNone in 4.2. VPC and Ceph are moving out of TP status and are full GA features. HA entered TP status back when it was usable, but not easy to use. Since then HA is no longer functioning in the system, so it is no longer in TP and all references to it should be purged (as you’ve been doing).\r\n\r\n3.
