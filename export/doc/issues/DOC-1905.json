You can retrieve extended information (primarily useful for debugging) by specifying -events -events-verbose.\"  There are no such flags, in 4.2.2 nor 4.3.0.\r\n# \"Modify Service State\" This is just weird. For this section title, the basic idea should be that you can change a service's state using the \"service\" (RHEL6) or \"systemctl\" (RHEL7) commands, the name of the service, and the state change you want to make, one of [ start | stop | restart | status ], where \"status\" shows you the current state (doesn't change state). The use of euserv-describe-services to view the service state is already shown in the section above it. It also doesn't cover all the Euca services. There's some value in the text about maintenance of the SC, but similar text could apply to any service. Anyway, none of this section has anything to do with \"Inspect System Health\", the section it's part of, maybe this should be its own section as a cloud task.\r\n\r\nI don't know where/who this info came from. If the docs team knows, maybe we could go to those SMEs for answers.\r\n\r\nFodder for later work, nothing critical here.\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Inspect System Health problems","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12100":"0|i03v6v:","customfield_10000":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_11600":["lincoln.thomas(lincoln.thomas)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/46124/comment/107474","id":"107474","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"One more useful check of system health is the {{euserv-describe-node-controllers --show-headers}} command, which shows each NC's zone, host, and state.
