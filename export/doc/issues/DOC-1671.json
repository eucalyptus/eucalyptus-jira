In other cases, I'm seeing some javascript assets showing as a HTML response that contains this:\r\n{code}\r\n<h3 class=\"header\" id=\"pagetitle\">404 Not Found</h3>\r\n<div style=\"min-height: 26rem;\">\r\n        <p>The resource you have requested was not found.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis tells me that the console server provided this \"bad\" content. So, I disabled caching in the dev tools and reloaded the page. Bingo! It renders properly now and I can login and use the console!\r\nI think this may kick back to the console team to debug now.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2015-09-16T13:25:45.721-0500","updated":"2015-09-16T13:27:31.461-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/38233/comment/91880","id":"91880","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"I got the problem to happen again. I noticed it after running load test on a single instance behind an ELB overnight, then adding a 2nd instance this morning. One of those instances is returning a 404 on an angular-sanitize.min.js file, repeatably. It is the older of the instances which is returning the 404 instead of the file.\r\n\r\nI think I got to the bottom of this issue. Yesterday and today, the 2nd instance had been added on a new day. Therefore, that new instance got the nightly packages. The big deal here is that the static assets are served with a url path that includes the version, to avoid upgrade issues with caching older versions of files. It's normal cache-busting between versions of software.\r\n\r\nOne server provided the page that included links to static assets. Some of those assets were requested from 1 server, some from the other. Both should be able to serve them, but they both had a different static path they knew to be right and if they got the wrong static path, 404.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story, update all of your console instances at once in a scaling group behind an ELB!
