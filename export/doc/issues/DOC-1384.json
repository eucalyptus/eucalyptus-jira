I think it should be under a section called something like \"API Services Running As Instances\" since the Eucalyptus Image Service and the ELB service are instances instead of physical machines.  It should be focused primarily to cloud administrators because they are the only ones that have access to these instances directly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think we need to ask Engineering about the following logs:\r\n\r\n* cloud-cluster.log (located on the CLC)\r\n* jetty-request-<date>.log (located on CLC)\r\n* cloud-requests.log (located on UFS components)\r\n* startup.log (looks like every Java component – CLC, UFS, SC, Vmware Broker, Walrus)\r\n* upgrade.log (same as startup.log)\r\n\r\nI think once those are documented, we should be good.\r\n\r\nDoes this help?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-04T10:43:19.523-0600","updated":"2014-12-04T10:43:19.523-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/30579/comment/79856","id":"79856","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tvo","name":"tvo","key":"tvo","accountId":"557058:b5156799-e790-48f5-b070-50b67b3c16f1","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/632d7478aa2e813a109254ca2e20dc11?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10121%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/632d7478aa2e813a109254ca2e20dc11?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10121%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/632d7478aa2e813a109254ca2e20dc11?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10121%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/632d7478aa2e813a109254ca2e20dc11?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10121%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Thanhnguyet Vo","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"body":"[~tony], Can you take a look at Harold's inquiry about the above logs and verify if they are correctly associated with the components shown?
