I have two concerns, maybe just one concern and one misunderstanding.\n\nFirst, the euca-create-tags isn't scheduled for release until 3.3.0. Are you asking us to document things like this early, or are you making a point that I just don't get (a safe bet, in my case)?\n\nSecond, should we go back and document these in our 3.2.0 release notes, or just place them in the 3.2.1 (or 3.2.2, depending on time) release notes? By the way, all release notes, starting at 3.2.1, will be in one document. At 3.2.1, we'll also include the release notes for 3.2.0, and then just add release notes on top as we go.\n\nMaybe most importantly: How did you all find out about these issues? I'm curious how these fell through the cracks and why we didn't catch them sooner. Was the content there but we just didn't understand the implications for our customers? Or was there a mad rush at the end and we didn't communicate well? I'm just curious how we can avoid this in the future.

But it doesn't work against Eucalyptus because, of course, Eucalyptus itself doesn't do tags yet. So there's the potential for confusion if the user sees the command and tries to use it and fails. They'll get some error like this:\n\n[root@d-16 ~]# euca-describe-tags\nDescribeTagsType: Unknown request of type: DescribeTagsType\n\nI suppose since 3.2.1 is soon we probably don't need to go back and update the relnotes for 3.2.0. I would have liked some of the major 3.2 changes to be documented but as long as we get them into 3.2.1 I'm OK.\n\nAs far as how these issues are found, they come in from various areas--word of mouth on IRC, just running into them during the nightly testing, etc.\n\nHope this helps!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tgerla","name":"tgerla","key":"tgerla","accountId":"557058:e18f44c8-7078-4706-89e3-47f30f2483ee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/feec4781b02a795ea0e448a8ac2fa116?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtgerla%26avatarId%3D10404%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/feec4781b02a795ea0e448a8ac2fa116?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtgerla%26avatarId%3D10404%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/feec4781b02a795ea0e448a8ac2fa116?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtgerla%26avatarId%3D10404%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/feec4781b02a795ea0e448a8ac2fa116?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtgerla%26avatarId%3D10404%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"tgerla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-25T12:11:17.676-0600","updated":"2013-01-25T12:11:17.676-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/18263/comment/39082","id":"39082","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"That's more or less the way things have always worked with euca2ools:  there are occasionally commands or options there that AWS supports but $arbitrary_other_cloud does not.
