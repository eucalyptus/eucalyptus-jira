Use euca-create-keypair and euca-create-group\r\n   * Euca2ools now looks for configuration settings in the following order:\r\n\r\n      * command line has top priority\r\n      * deprecated config file\r\n      * environment variables\r\n      * AWS credential file\r\n      * new style config\r\n      * ~/eucarc\r\n   * euca-bundle-vol, unbundle, and euca-bundle-image don't require access keys, only .509 certificate\r\n   * Descriptions have been reworded to make more sense.\r\n   * Format of debug output has changed. Presented differently for clarity and to show more information. Most commands have the same output format.\r\n   * (check out euca-run-instances -b, DEVICE-MAPPED option, which is also in another command. The description changed and might be more helpful for doc)\r\n   * You can abbreviate any long option in a command, as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous. For example, --disable-api-termination can be --disable-api\r\n   * Most commands use -h for help. Some commands use the -h option for passing along a request. You can use --help to get help output for any command.\r\n   * See also http://blog.devzero.com\r\n- euare-useraddloginprofile and euare-usermodloginprofile employ a -p/--password option as the means for a user to supply the tool with one's new/changed password.  Seeing as using that option would cause the password to show up in one's command history, I made it optional. If you don't use it, the program will prompt you for the new password instead.\r\n","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Write 3.0.0 Euca2ools Release Notes ","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=smarvin","name":"smarvin","key":"smarvin","accountId":"557058:05586e44-7f70-416d-9933-1d102bb4cf60","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Scot Marvin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=smarvin","name":"smarvin","key":"smarvin","accountId":"557058:05586e44-7f70-416d-9933-1d102bb4cf60","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Scot Marvin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i01tmv:","customfield_10000":"3_*:*_2_*:*_1727521265_*|*_10002_*:*_1_*:*_276594502_*|*_1_*:*_2_*:*_4323648647_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10009_*:*_1_*:*_8353","customfield_10001":"2013-06-13T12:24:11.114-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10004":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["awithrow(awithrow)","smarvin(smarvin)","scottb(scottb)"],"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/DOC-792/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/20355/comment/47456","id":"47456","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=awithrow","name":"awithrow","key":"awithrow","accountId":"557058:489310fd-31eb-49f8-8552-e87970faf51b","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a5a27d1c4012a61174df794fd8406eb5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Aaron Withrow","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here's a pull request that adds the fixed issues for Euca2ools 3.0.0.  \n\nhttps://github.com/eucalyptus/documentation/pull/85\n\nJust need to flesh out the What's New section now.
