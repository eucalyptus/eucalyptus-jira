In the past, the CC would pick up the single name server through the VNET_DNS entry in the eucalyptus.conf configuration file and should have been updated dynamically when the system.dns.nameserveraddress property on the CLC was updated.\r\n\r\nAs a result of fixing EUCA-7814 and EUCA-8406, this behavior has changed slightly. As a result, the system.dns.nameserveraddress CLC property now accepts a single entry or a coma-delimited ordered list of name servers (e.g. \"10.1.1.1,192.168.1.1,172.16.1.1\"). This list will be pushed down the CC and later be provided in the same order of priority to the VM. The VNET_DNS configuration parameter on CC is still a single name server entry (i.e. not a list). \r\n\r\nIn terms of behavior change, the following establish the rules of application of both the property settings on the CLC and the VNET_DNS entry on CC:\r\n\r\n1) if: cloud property is unset, instance dns is disabled\r\n   then: backend chooses 127.0.0.1 as nameserver\r\n\r\n2) if: cloud property is set, and instance dns is disabled\r\n   then: clc sends IP of cloud property, backend chooses that value as\r\n   nameserver\r\n\r\n3) if: cloud property is unset, and instance dns is enabled\r\n   then: clc sends IP of cloud controller (DNS service), backend chooses\r\n   that value as nameserver\r\n\r\n4) if: cloud property is set, and instance_dns is enabled\r\n   then: clc sends IP of of cloud controller (DNS service) first, and IP of\r\n   cloud property second, backend chooses both of them in order\r\n\r\n*) if, for any of the above cases,VNET_DNS is set on the backend,\r\n backend will include it last, behind all of the others with one\r\n exception: when neither property not instnace DNS is set (case 1\r\n above), then backend will choose value of VNET_DNS as nameserver)\r\n{panel}","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Update

I just fixed EUCA-7349 which takes care of the VNET_DOMAINNAME. The overall goal is to deprecate these 2 configuration options in the eucalyptus.conf file of the CC eventually. We are not doing this in 4.0 to give time to customers to adjust. \r\n\r\nIn regards to the VNET_DOMAINNAME, if the CLC 'cloud.vmstate.instance_subdomain' gets modified, it will be passed to the CC which will override the VNET_DOMAINNAME value given to the CC through eucalyptus.conf. From there the DHCP configuration file will contain the name configured on the CLC. Same as with VNET_DNS, new instances will pick up the new domain search name in their resolv.conf file and the instances that were running at the time of the change will get their updates within 24 hours through DHCP renewal.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=chuck","name":"chuck","key":"chuck","accountId":"557058:95e4b012-7cd1-4fd1-995d-eba573d35653","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/39b69736417cafd9d6dddeb1c2e00169?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dchuck%26avatarId%3D12900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Chuck","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-13T22:23:07.416-0600","updated":"2014-02-13T22:23:07.416-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/27349/comment/77491","id":"77491","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=smarvin","name":"smarvin","key":"smarvin","accountId":"557058:05586e44-7f70-416d-9933-1d102bb4cf60","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/95e97cadbfbf5d0194fdb73f1eee6cc8?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dsmarvin%26avatarId%3D12601%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Scot Marvin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~chuck], this looks a little more deep than I originally thought.
