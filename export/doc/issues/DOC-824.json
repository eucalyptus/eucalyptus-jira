Below is the explanation that helps convey the understanding needed to leverage the LDAP/AD mapping to IAM accounts.  We should determine how to best integrate this information, along with the information found in DOC-820, with the current documentation.  Any help needed with this update, please let me know.\r\n\r\n*Updated Explanation* \r\n\r\nFor the mapping exercise of having an account group called users with all the users with gidNubmer=100 inside the account group, the key here deals with the id-attribute and filter of each section:\r\n\r\n* accounting-groups\r\n* groups-partition\r\n* groups\r\n* users\r\n\r\nUnderstanding object class types are really important here. More information about object class types, refer to the [LDAP Models RFC|http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.txt] under the \"2.4.  Object Classes\".  \r\n\r\n*accounting-groups*\r\n\r\nFrom looking at the LIC file parser, accounting-groups are more focused to ou, dc type objects.  So, for example, if you had the base _ou=Group,dc=net4,dc=lan_, and under that, you had the following sub-ou's:\r\n\r\n* ou=Sales,ou=Group,dc=net4,dc=lan\r\n* ou=Engineering,ou=Group,dc=net4,dc=lan\r\n\r\nThe ou for Sales/Engineering may look like the following:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ndn: ou=Sales,ou=Group,dc=net4,dc=lan\r\nobjectClass: organizationalUnit\r\nou: Sales\r\n\r\ndn: ou=Engineering,ou=Group,dc=net4,dc=lan\r\nobjectClass: organizationalUnit\r\nou: Engineering\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThen you would set the id-attribute to _ou_, and _filter_ to _objectClass: organizationalunit_, to create an account for Engineering and Sales.  In short, accounting-groups is more focused on STRUCTURAL object classes.  For more information about this, refer to the [LDAP Models RFC|http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4512.txt].  Here is a brief section that explains this a bit more:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n2.4.2.  Structural Object Classes\r\n\r\n   As stated in [X.501]:\r\n\r\n      An object class defined for use in the structural specification of\r\n      the DIT is termed a structural object class.  Structural object\r\n      classes are used in the definition of the structure of the names\r\n      of the objects for compliant entries.\r\n\r\n      An object or alias entry is characterized by precisely one\r\n      structural object class superclass chain which has a single\r\n      structural object class as the most subordinate object class.\r\n      This structural object class is referred to as the structural\r\n      object class of the entry.\r\n\r\n      Structural object classes are related to associated entries:\r\n\r\n        - an entry conforming to a structural object class shall\r\n          represent the real-world object constrained by the object\r\n          class;\r\n\r\n        - DIT structure rules only refer to structural object classes;\r\n          the structural object class of an entry is used to specify the\r\n          position of the entry in the DIT;\r\n\r\n        - the structural object class of an entry is used, along with an\r\n          associated DIT content rule, to control the content of an\r\n          entry.\r\n\r\n      The structural object class of an entry shall not be changed.\r\n\r\n   Each structural object class is a (direct or indirect) subclass of\r\n   the 'top' abstract object class.\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n*groups-partition*\r\n\r\ngroup-partitions are really powerful because you can pre-define account names, based upon \"groups\" that are present in LDAP/AD.  For example, with the example of the users with the gidNumber=100 in the same group called \"users\" - a groups-partition would possibly look like the following:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\"groups-partition\": {\r\n          \"accountgid100\": [\"users\"],\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis will then correlate the group \"users\", which will be discovered in the \"groups\" section of the LIC file, to the account \"accountgid100\".\r\n\r\n*groups and users* \r\n\r\ngroups and users are for more granular choosing of object class types. The key with these options is understanding what defines a group/user in LDAP/AD.  For example, here is a user and group:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\ndn: uid=user01,ou=people,dc=msjackson,dc=stankonia,dc=com\r\nobjectClass: top\r\nobjectClass: person\r\nobjectClass: organizationalPerson\r\nobjectClass: posixAccount\r\nobjectClass: shadowAccount\r\nobjectClass: inetOrgPerson\r\nobjectClass: inetLocalMailRecipient\r\nuid: user01\r\ncn: user 01\r\ndisplayName: user 01\r\ngecos: user 01\r\ngivenName: user\r\nsn: 01\r\ntitle: Test User 01\r\nmail: user01@msjackson.stankonia.com\r\nemployeeNumber: 01\r\nuidNumber: 4001\r\ngidNumber: 4001\r\nhomeDirectory: /home/user01\r\nloginShell: /bin/bash\r\nl: Fake Town\r\nmailLocalAddress: user01@msjackson.stankonia.com\r\nmailRoutingAddress: user01@msjackson.stankonia.com\r\nuserPassword:: e1NTSEF9N1A5Zi85NS9OSkltVkdEY1dIK09hVHBVUFYxN2hCOFY=\r\nshadowExpire: -1\r\nshadowFlag: 0\r\nshadowWarning: 7\r\nshadowMin: 8\r\nshadowMax: 999999\r\nshadowLastChange: 10877\r\npostalCode: 01234\r\no: MsJackson-Outkast-StankoniaInc\r\nmobile: +33 (0)6 xx xx xx xx\r\nhomePhone: +33 (0)5 xx xx xx xx\r\npostalAddress: 123 Fake St., Goleta, CA 93117\r\ninitials: GSSAPI\r\n\r\ndn: cn=user01,ou=groups,dc=msjackson,dc=stankonia,dc=com\r\nobjectClass: top\r\nobjectClass: posixGroup\r\ncn: user01\r\ngidNumber: 4001\r\nmemberUid: user01\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSo if you wanted to differentiate which objects are users and groups, the LIC file section for users and groups may look like the following:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n\"groups\":{\r\n\r\n\"base-dn\":\"ou=groups,dc=msjackson,dc=stankonia,dc=com\",\r\n\"id-attribute\":\"cn\",\r\n\"member-attribute\":\"memberUid\",\r\n\"selection\":{\r\n\"filter\":\"objectClass=posixGroup\",\r\n}\r\n\r\n},\r\n\r\n\r\n\"users\":{\r\n\r\n\"base-dn\":\"ou=people,dc=msjackson,dc=stankonia,dc=com\",\r\n\"id-attribute\":\"uid\",\r\n\"sasl-id-attribute\":\"uid\",\r\n\"selection\":{\r\n\"filter\":\"objectClass=inetOrgPerson\",\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nSo what this does is grab all the users and groups defined with these attributes in LDAP/AD.  What maps where groups and users end up regarding accounts *DEPENDS* upon the accounting-groups or groups-partition definitions.  So, typically, if someone has defined an _ou_ for Sales, users and groups are structured underneath that _ou_.  If a groups-partition has been defined, then the groups found in LDAP/AD that are defined in each account, will add all the groups to that account, and will look up each user that is a member of those groups and add them to the account.","customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-42","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"LDAP/AD Integration:  Update Identity Mapping Explanation","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=hspencer","name":"hspencer","key":"hspencer","accountId":"557058:4a3a93bc-21f8-4658-9f5b-9cb484c910a7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ea43d7b9d5b27468a749f9bd25650176?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dhspencer%26avatarId%3D10407%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Harold Spencer Jr.","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i020ev:","customfield_10000":"1_*:*_1_*:*_35796877019_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0","customfield_10001":"2013-05-06T21:14:35.613-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":["Maintainability-PM"],"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["hspencer(hspencer)","scottb(scottb)","shashi(shashi)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/20979/comment/44879","id":"44879","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=shashi","name":"shashi","key":"shashi","accountId":"557058:cc7ee5dc-1d4f-46c5-8068-6ae350275ba6","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/a22dc501b633d766a04aac00a6f07d91?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dshashi%26avatarId%3D11700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Shashi Mysore","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~hspencer], As discussed this afternoon, \"3.4-PM\" label is a product management internal label being used simply for organizing the issues in Jira.
