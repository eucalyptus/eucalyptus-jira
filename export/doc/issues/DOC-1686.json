Of particular note are TOOLS-572 and EUCA-10590, which eliminate the need for the zip files produced by eucalyptus's deprecated {{euca_conf --get-credentials}} command.  As usual, feel free to ask for clarification if needed.  In the highly-likely event I need to update this list I will add a comment that mentions the changes when I do so.\r\n\r\n* euca2ools 3.3.0 now requires version 0.4 of the {{requestbuilder}} python library.  If you install euca2ools with HP-provided RPM packages it will be installed automatically.\r\n* All commands use AWS signature version 4 for for all services except S3.  It can additionally be enabled for S3 on a per-region basis with the {{s3-force-sigv4}} region option in euca2ools.ini.  Note that Eucalyptus 4.2's object storage gateway is not compatible with AWS signature version 4.  (TOOLS-360, TOOLS-469)\r\n* Configuration for AWS's {{eu-central-1}} region has been added.  (TOOLS-524)\r\n* A CloudFormation URL for the {{localhost}} region has been added.  (TOOLS-579)\r\n* Configuration for the retired Eucalyptus Community Cloud has been removed.\r\n* The new eulb-describe-load-balancer-attributes and eulb-modify-lb-attributes commands allow one to inspect and modify load balancers' attributes.  (TOOLS-527)\r\n* The new eulb-create-tags, eulb-describe-tags, and eulb-delete-tags commands allow one to create, view, and delete tags on load balancers.  (TOOLS-556)\r\n* eulb-create-lb-policy gained a -A option that simplifies entering multiple attributes.  (TOOLS-551)\r\n* The new euare-assumerole and euare-releaserole commands can be used inside an {{eval}} shell command to assume IAM roles.  (TOOLS-359)\r\n* The {{EUARE_URL}} environment variable has been removed.  Use {{AWS_IAM_URL}} instead.\r\n* For IAM commands that act on only one entity, those entities' names may now be supplied positionally.  For example, {{euare-usercreate alice}} works the same as {{euare-usercreate -u alice}}.\r\n* euare-accountcreate, euare-usercreate, and euare-useraddkey gained a \\-w/\\-\\-write-config option that causes them create new access keys and output a euca2ools.ini file instead of their usual output formats, simplifying credential distribution.  The service URLs it generates will be based on the IAM service's DNS domain; if the IAM service is accessed by IP address the output will not contain service URLs.  The \\-d/\\-\\-domain option can be used to override this by choosing the domain name explicitly.  Finally, the \\-l/\\-\\-set-default-user option causes the output to set the given user as the default user for the region.  Two examples follow.  (EUCA-10590){code}\r\neuare-useraddkey alice -w > ~/.euca/alice.ini\r\n\r\neuare-accountcreate bob -wld mycloud.example.com | mail -s \"Your credentials\" bob@example.com\r\n{code}\r\n* The eucalyptus-specific {{bootstrap}} and {{properties}} services may now be specified in euca2ools.ini files.\r\n* Commands that bundle images no longer require private keys to run.  Images bundled without private keys will not be signed, and will thus be incompatible with Eucalyptus 4.1 and earlier.  (TOOLS-572)\r\n* Commands that bundle images no longer require signing certificates to run.  Images bundled without signing certificates are incompatible with Eucalyptus 4.1 and earlier and cannot be unbundled without cloud administrator assistance.  (TOOLS-572)\r\n* Commands that bundle images can fetch the cloud's signing certificate automatically, provided they have been configured with the {{bootstrap}} service's endpoint and the cloud runs Eucalyptus 4.2 or later.  Normal users require the {{euserv:DescribeServiceCertificates}} capability in their IAM policies to use this functionality.  (TOOLS-572)\r\n* euca-unbundle and euca-download-and-unbundle no longer consider bundles with certain checksums to be corrupt.
