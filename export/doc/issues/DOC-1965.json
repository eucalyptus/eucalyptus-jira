On the Start CLC page http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/starting_euca_clc.html : If you're upgrading, skip the \"clcadmin-initialize-cloud\" step, because you've already done it when you did the \"Restore the Database\" step. If you re-initialize the cloud this way, bad things can happen.\r\n\r\n2. Because of EUCA-12631 \"Can't re-enable NC on multi-cluster after upgrade\": \r\n\r\nIn the Upgrade NC section http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/rhel7_upgrade_nc_hosts.html, as the first step, de-register the NC before shutting it down. (The Install of 4.3 already includes the step that will (re-)register it.) On the CC that has the NC registered:\r\n{noformat}\r\nclusteradmin-deregister-nodes NC_IP_ADDRESS\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nIn the Upgrade non-NC section http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/rhel7_upgrade_non_nc_hosts.html, as the first step, de-register _all_ NCs before shutting them down. (The Install of 4.3 already includes the step that will (re-)register them.) \r\nOn each CC that has NCs registered:\r\n{noformat}\r\nclusteradmin-deregister-nodes NC_IP_ADDRESS1 NC_IP_ADDRESS2 ...\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n3. Back up cloud state: In addition to backing up the cloud state http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/rhel7_backup_cloud_state.html: \r\n* Do it before each NC OS upgrade (the parts that apply to that NC).\r\n* Do it before upgrading the non-NC set, except for the parts that apply only to NCs. Certain things about the cloud state will have changed since you did the original backup, including the cloud database, configuration files, volumes (when the block storage back end is Overlay), snapshots (block storage DAS or Overlay), and object storage contents (when the back end is Walrus).\r\n\r\n4. In the recover cloud data section http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#admin-guide/restore_postgres.html: If you're upgrading, skip this step:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n\tâ€¢ Start CLC service \r\nsystemctl start eucalyptus-cloud.service\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nWe don't want to start the CLC service yet because we haven't restored the rest of the cloud data yet. Starting the CLC appears in the Installation steps, which is where we want them to start it.\r\n\r\n5. In http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/register_services.html:\r\n\r\nIf you're upgrading, skip everything except \"Register the Node Controllers\". If you're upgrading an NC, just register that NC (on the CC that had it registered before). If you're upgrading the set of non-NC hosts, register all the NCs (on each CC that had NCs registered). You don't need to register the rest during the non-NC upgrade, because those registrations are already listed in the cloud database which you recovered before getting here.\r\n\r\n(The

http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/master/#install-guide/rhel7_backup_cloud_state.html are for upgrading 4.2.2 to 4.3, on the same OS version. The stuff after that walks you through doing an OS upgrade, which includes installing 4.3 from scratch on the new OS (but restoring cloud data). We tell readers to follow the regular install steps as part of that, e.g. for non-NCs:\r\n{quote}\r\nInstall Eucalyptus 4.3.\r\nThis is a clean install of Eucalyptus on the set of non-NC host machines.\r\nSee \"Configure Dependencies\" through \"Set Up Security Groups.\"\r\n{quote}\r\nBecause there are some things in those regular install steps you need to do differently if you're installing 4.3 as part of an overall upgrade, we need to do these insertions inline, so upgraders do it right. Some of the changes here are to be made outside of those install steps, like the {{clusteradmin-deregister-nodes}} commands. I wish they could all be added outside, but I don't think they all can be, unless you see a way, without readers having to remember \"oh, in this install step 5 I have to do this differently based on what it said back in the upgrade section step
