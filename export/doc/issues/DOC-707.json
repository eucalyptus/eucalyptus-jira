external numbers may be greater than total numbers.

If the report is requested after 'external' counter is updated but before the 'total' counter is updated, the numbers may appear out of their natural order. In stable state (without network traffic), the numbers should eventually (within a few minutes, depending on the polling frequency selected by the user: reporting.default_poll_interval_mins and

The external numbers can be greater than total numbers. This is because the two types of measurements come from different hosts (external is from the CC and totals from the NC). These hosts sample and deliver numbers to the reporting subsystem at different times. If the report is requested after the external counter is updated but before the total counter is updated, the numbers could appear out of their natural order.
