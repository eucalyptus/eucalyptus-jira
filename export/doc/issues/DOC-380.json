How to expand Walrus storage capacity on-the-fly: This can be accomplished with LVM and adding remote disks to a backing storage system that Walrus uses (a SAN for example). This is not a Eucalyptus feature/configuration exactly, but rather a Linux storage configuration issue.\r\n\r\n2. How to use another backing store for Walrus, particularly distributed file-systems such as Ceph or Gluster. These can be integrated (we do not explicitly support it) simply as back-end storage for Walrus by mounting it as a file-system for Walrus to write to. This could even be used in-lieu of DRBD (we certainly wouldn't support this officially, but it can be done easily).\r\n\r\n3. NFS vs iSCSI for external file systems for Walrus or the Storage Controller to use. What are the tradeoffs and is one strictly better than the other? Our answer is that iSCSI is better because its failure semantics give better assurances of data durability.\r\n\r\n4. How does Eucalyptus as a system use storage? Where does it need it and what are the best practices for allowing capacity to grow as you add users to your Eucalyptus user-base? LVM is an essential tool in any Linux storage admin's toolbox and we should describe how best to use it and which directories Eucalyptus needs to have storage available in as usage of the system increases. These broadly include: VM image cache, Walrus object store, SC volume storage, NC blobstore (would need Dmitrii's input here), and Walrus snapshot storage. We can also describe data flows in the system so that storage and network admins can optimize their systems to support Eucalyptus's usage patterns.\r\n\r\nContact points in the storage team are Zach and Ye. We should also bring Shashi in to see if any additional use-cases can be covered simply with better documentation for storage.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"PRD-42","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Storage Best-Practices and In-Depth Guide to Walrus and the Storage Controller","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=zhill","name":"zhill","key":"zhill","accountId":"557058:70b4b768-eb1f-43a3-a225-3353d0fe3f56","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/239165321c2f152424c9be883721791a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dzhill%26avatarId%3D10406%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Zach Hill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_10000":null,"customfield_12100":"0|i01e3b:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":"2012-12-19T08:48:34.249-0600","customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":["Maintainability-PM"],"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["kmeredith(kmeredith)","zhill(zhill)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/DOC-380/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
