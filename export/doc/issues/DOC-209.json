The '-L' is the CC looking for existence of a chain\n(i.e. the command fails if the chain isn't present, which is what the CC is\ntrying to determine). The '-D' is verifying that the rule has been fully\ncleared (i.e. it will fail when the rule is no longer present).\n\nIt is understood that these types of negative tests are confusing, and we try\nto keep the actual eucalyptus logs (cc.log in this case) free from negative\nerror results (healthy CC will have few or no EUCAERROR lines). However, the\nhttp_cc_error_log file is out of our control in a sense, in that the messages\nprinted here are largely from eucalyptus dependencies (iptables, dhcpd, etc).\n\nA suggestion here is to inform users that http_cc_error_log is for support/eng.\nactivities, but it will be very difficult for users to use this log for\ndebugging (since euca doesn't exclusively control its contents). Does this make\nsense?\n\nCore issue understood, we develop with this principle in mind, but largely we\nfocus on euca logs (cc.log, nc.log).\n\n-D\n\nOn Wed Mar 14 21:16:18 2012, andrew.hamilton wrote:\n> It appears that /usr/share/eucalyptus/euca_ipt is incorrectly setting\n> up rules\n> for IPTables. /var/log/eucalyptus/http-cc_error_log shows the errors\n> below on\n> every IPTables operation that occurs when running and terminating\n> instances\n> (could be more but these are what I checked while troubleshooting\n> another\n> issue).\n>\n> It looks as though the last line of the iptables-restore file is\n> trying to do a\n> listing of a specific chain with numeric output when that isn't an\n> operation\n> supported by iptables-restore.\n>\n> The second issue below attempts to delete a rule that is no longer\n> present in\n> IPTables so it fails.\n>\n> IPTables still works even though this is occuring but it is still an\n> error that\n> could confuse an user if they are having other possible issues with\n> IPTables.\n> We should try to limit the number of errors that we consistently print\n> to logs\n> at the very least to help out support.\n>\n> =======================================================================\n>\n> DO OLD EUCA_IPT iptables-restore: line 8 failed iptables-restore\n> failed:\n> rulefile contents: # Generated by iptables-save v1.3.5 on Wed Mar 14\n> 23:58:30\n> 2012 *filter :INPUT ACCEPT [665:294955] :FORWARD DROP [0:0] :OUTPUT\n> ACCEPT\n> [665:295339] -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT\n> -A FORWARD\n> -d ! 10.110.190.0/255.255.254.0 -j ACCEPT -L qMvv0p1gX6w2MMey9f8nDg==\n> -n COMMIT\n> # Completed on Wed Mar 14 23:58:30 2012 [EUCAERROR] iptables-restore\n> failed DO\n> OLD EUCA_IPT done DO OLD EUCA_IPT iptables-restore: line 9 failed\n> iptables-restore failed: rulefile contents: # Generated by iptables-\n> save v1.3.5\n> on Wed Mar 14 23:58:30 2012 *filter :INPUT ACCEPT [0:0] :FORWARD DROP\n> [0:0]\n> :OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0] :qMvv0p1gX6w2MMey9f8nDg== -
