I have questions/feedback about that doc in https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BTS/Euca+4.3.0+Other+Documentation+Changes , and questions about what other ref archs our User Docs should point to, for example:\r\n\r\nThe document referenced, http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=4AA6-2547ENW , has some issues I see:\r\nFigure 1 misspells: \"Objuect\", \"Controler\" (many), and \"Avalilability\", not very professional looking.\r\nI see these issues were cleaned up for the FastStart evaluation guide: http://engage.hpe.com/PDFViewer?ID={aa557af5-799f-4d66-adea-e278d8416e18}_4AA6-3136ENW\r\nIt says \"Scalable Object Storage (SOS)\", whereas our docs only say \"Object Storage\". Which is correct? Also, it never explains what SOS actually is. It only explains OSG and OSP. It's really the superset of these.\r\nIt mentions that the CC and NC are written in C, and CLC and SC are Java, and doesn't say anything for the other services. Why should it say any languages? It doesn't affect users at all.\r\nIt says that arch is \"designed specifically for pilot or proof-of-concept deployments ... other reference architectures should be consulted if performance of the deployment is a priority.\" But it doesn't point to any other ref archs. Should it? Or should we add those pointers to this Euca Ref Arch section of the User Docs? I know of two separate publicly-accessible Wiki pages (and children), but I don't know which should be referenced by published docs:\r\n\r\nThere's also Eucalyptus Reference Architectures (most recently by Kristina Hadges, created by Colby Dyess). Is that current / maintained?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLincoln\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Reference Architecture doc needs to be updated / verified","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri Meredith","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri Meredith","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_10000":"1_*:*_1_*:*_25554258933_*|*_5_*:*_1_*:*_0","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i03un3:","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10004":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_11600":["grze(grze)","kmeredith(kmeredith)"],"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/45509/comment/106251","id":"106251","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri Meredith","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This doc http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=4AA6-2547ENW\r\n\r\nExisting references in these Euca docs -\r\nhttp://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/shared/index.html -
