Basically it's a standard RHEL/CentOS system administration tool for managing iSCSI targets (block storage volumes). This \"SCSI Target Administration Utility\" is comprised of a service process \"tgtd\", and a CLI \"tgtadm\" for sys admins to create and manage their iSCSI targets. Eucalyptus depends on it and uses it under the covers to create and manage Eucalyptus block storage volumes when the provider is either DAS or overlay. (If the backend is a SAN, the SAN providers have their own specific utilities that Eucalyptus uses.) I don't think we need to teach sys admins about it in our docs, since it's not a Eucalyptus-specific thing, we just need them to make sure the tgtd service is running so Eucalyptus can issue tgtadm commands. Sys admins won't use the CLI since they'll use Eucalyptus mechanisms instead for their block storage needs. (Unless they use it to manage other block storage that's outside of their use of Eucalyptus, in which case they're on their own.)\r\n# That's FYI. We don't need to put it into the docs, since we're not teaching them... (per above). You can use that chkconfig list command to list the status of any service, Euca or otherwise, which sys admins should already know.\r\n# Yes. Say that the SC uses tgtd, so tgtd needs to be running any time the SC is running, so start it before starting the SC.\r\n# Yes, just like DOC-1550 says to use chkconfig to make it run on boot, so the same for tgtd as you do for SC, they should be the same. As for the admin guide, I don't see anything to change. The sections about shutting down and restarting Eucalyptus don't require doing so for tgtd as well. You can leave it running. The only time you need to restart it is if you're re-installing SC (not just restarting the service), as already mentioned in the IG.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln
