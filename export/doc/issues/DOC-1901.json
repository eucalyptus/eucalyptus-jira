Comments are below.\r\nMost require discussion as they are my personal opinion, and not necessarily valid.\r\n\r\n\"topic\", \"section\", and \"guide\" seems to be used interchangeably - for example:\r\nhttp://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#shared/install_section.html\r\n\"This topic helps\", \"This section details\", etc\r\nhttp://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/index.html\r\n\"This guide walks you through\"\r\n\r\nI personally like consistency, but this may be ok.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements (http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/system_requirements.html) may need updates.\r\n\r\nFor example, mention that CPUs with x86_64 instruction set architecture are expected, and perhaps the need for hardware-assisted virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD SVM). Current docs mentions two 2GHz cores but there are modern server CPUs clocked lower than 2GHz that are much more performant compared to 5 years old 3GHz CPUs.\r\nI think x86_64, VT, and multi-core are required CPU features, but it is difficult to come up with a GHz requirement.\r\n\r\nNetworking mode: I believe VPCMIDO mode is the \"official\" name - current docs refer to VPC and MidoNet, VPC (MidoNet), etc\r\n\r\nAlso, consistency on how all modes are spelled (uppercase, lowercase) would be nice.\r\nI believe internal documentation uses uppercase: EDGE, MANAGED, MANAGED NO-VLAN, VPCMIDO\r\n\r\nPlan Networking Modes (http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/planning_networking_modes.html)\r\nYour choice of networking mode depends on the following considerations:\r\n•\tDo you plan to support elastic IPs and security groups?\r\n•\tDo you plan to provide your own network DHCP server?\r\nGiven that all 4 modes (EDGE, MANAGED, MANAGED NO-VLAN, VPCMIDO) support elastic IPs and DHCP, this needs to be updated.\r\nThe 2 supported modes in 4.3 are EDGE and VPCMIDO. It seems like the choice is between support for AWS EC2 classic networking or AWS VPC networking modes.\r\n\r\nDOC-1448 - Configure Bridges (http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/configuring_bridge.html)\r\nIt may be helpful to be explicit on the 2 modes that require bridge configuration: MANAGED NO-VLAN and EDGE. Currently we have \"For Managed (No VLAN) and EDGE modes\" and it may not be clear that MANAGED mode does not require it.\r\nVPCMIDO mode does require bridge on all NCs, but the configuration is slightly different compared to the other modes - i.e., there is no need to attach a physical NIC to the bridge (perhaps Matt Bacchi could provide information on how it is done on QA system)\r\n\r\nDOC-1759 - Are both \"Disable the Firewall\" (http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/disable_firewall.html ) and \"Disable FirewallD on RHEL 7\" (http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/rhel7_disable_firewalld.html) sections needed? Perhaps just merge?\r\n\r\nDOC-1805 - Configure SELinux (http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/configure_selinux.html)\r\nIt is not clear what is Eucalyptus' position wrt SELinux. Is it recommended, mandatory, users' choice?\r\nIf new installs require RHEL7, mentioning RHEL6 in this section may be confusing.\r\n\r\nDOC-1896 - Install MidoNet for Eucalyptus (http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/install_midokura_installation.html)\r\n\"how to install Midokura\" should be \"how to install MidoNet\"\r\n\"Install Midolman on the Cloud Controller\" should be \"Install Midolman on Cloud Controller, Node Controllers, and MidoNet Gateway Nodes\"\r\n\"To install the Midolman agent on the node controllers and user facing service:\" should be \"Midolman agent is required on the Cloud Controller, Node Controllers, and MidoNet Gateway nodes. To install Midolman agent:\"\r\n\r\nGray boxes are missing for some yum commands.\r\n\r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"DOC-1854","customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"General doc feedback from Mauricio","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri Meredith","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri Meredith","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i03v0v:","customfield_10000":null,"customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10004":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_11600":["kmeredith(kmeredith)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/DOC-1901/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/46008/comment/114173","id":"114173","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kmeredith","name":"kmeredith","key":"kmeredith","accountId":"557058:ad01e29f-e62e-4f95-b458-a96ea25c65e5","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8962f6c2075b2cf80ed6daccff85c8a7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Keri Meredith","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Added comment re: bridges from [~tsugawa] in DOC-2037 -
