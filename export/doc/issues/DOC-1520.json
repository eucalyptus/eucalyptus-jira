The queue, in this case, refers to some memory where data will be stored as it is streamed to the OSG. The queue gets drained as the data is processed (sent to the backend system like Walrus or Riak). Increasing the size of the queue allows more data to be received, but has a side effect of increasing the memory used by Eucalyptus. The timeout refers to a number of seconds that the system will wait for a slot in the queue to open up. So, increasing these parameters can conceivably allow more data to be received in the OSG. However, the downside is that Java has this hard-limit on the amount of memory it will use. You can increase Java's limit by using -Xmx4096m (this example increases the limit to 4gb). You can add this command line parameter to the eucalyptus.conf file in the CLOUD_OPTS section. \r\n\r\nRight now, we do not really have metrics to create an exact formula because proper tuning depends on network throughput, machine speed and potentially the load of the system from other processes / threads. I am opening this ticket because I don't think we have those parameters well-documented now and probably need to get something together.
