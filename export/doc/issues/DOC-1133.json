This only applies if LDAP/AD integration is not enabled.  If LDAP/AD integration is enabled, the only passwords that can be changed are users not associated with LDAP/AD.

The admin user documentation that you are referring to is the admin user of each 'non-eucalyptus' account.

I also suggest to leave out the part about admins' passwords being stored as MD5 hashes. This is an implementation detail and is not specific to the account admin -- applies to all users when LDAP integration is not enabled. I think the main point when it comes to account admin passwords is not in what form they are stored but that login profiles for account admin are always managed by Eucalyptus (and not LDAP is it's enabled).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=rusvika","name":"rusvika","key":"rusvika","accountId":"557058:0f138bdf-f1d0-4468-9edd-e45575af47da","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c975ce5391bf03e1a9aa2a957435569b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Drusvika%26avatarId%3D10701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c975ce5391bf03e1a9aa2a957435569b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Drusvika%26avatarId%3D10701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c975ce5391bf03e1a9aa2a957435569b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Drusvika%26avatarId%3D10701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c975ce5391bf03e1a9aa2a957435569b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Drusvika%26avatarId%3D10701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Vika Felmetsger","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-08-28T13:00:07.029-0500","updated":"2015-08-28T13:00:07.029-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/26202/comment/107405","id":"107405","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tvo","name":"tvo","key":"tvo","accountId":"557058:b5156799-e790-48f5-b070-50b67b3c16f1","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/632d7478aa2e813a109254ca2e20dc11?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10121%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/632d7478aa2e813a109254ca2e20dc11?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10121%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/632d7478aa2e813a109254ca2e20dc11?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10121%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/632d7478aa2e813a109254ca2e20dc11?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10121%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Thanhnguyet Vo","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"body":"[~hspencer] on 7/12/16: \"This makes perfect sense.
