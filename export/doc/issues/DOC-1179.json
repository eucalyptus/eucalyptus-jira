But, in a good way: existing images do not become unavailable and there is no period of conversion that follows the upgrade. Instead, partition EMIs get converted whenever they are run for the first time, which is the same for all partition images, whether they were upgraded from before 4.0 or were added to a 4.0+ system.\r\n\r\nTo be able to run such images, one _does_ need an Imaging Service to be active. (If one tries to run an EMI that requires an Imaging Service without one present, the appropriate error will be returned, as shown in EUCA-9060.) Our instructions for installation and upgrade need a section on installing the Imaging Service. (This task is similar in scope and spirit to installing the ELB service task, but is perhaps more important because more users are likely to use partition images than to deploy load balancers.)\r\n\r\nIn sum, existing images will retain their EMIs after upgrade and will continue to be usable, subject to the same behavioral characteristics as new images. So, I would say there isn't much to say about upgrade, but there _is_ a good deal of new stuff to discuss about images in 4.0. I will tackle that in another ticket: perhaps DOC-1166?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dmitrii","name":"dmitrii","key":"dmitrii","accountId":"557058:1e0ea807-434b-4b54-967f-1dec4a9ede55","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/efb56b507e22d4fc0d8d5e900e5651d5?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddmitrii%26avatarId%3D15900%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Dmitrii Calzago","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-19T18:02:34.756-0500","updated":"2014-05-19T18:02:34.756-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
