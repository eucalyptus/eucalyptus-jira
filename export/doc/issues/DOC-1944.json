Also, disable service instances while upgrading the non-NC hosts.)_\r\n\r\nIn http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/instance_pack_migrate.html and http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/instance_unpack_migrate.html, and also http://packages.release.eucalyptus-systems.com/documentation/origin/master/#install-guide/rhel7_upgrade_non_nc_hosts.html :\r\n\r\nThe service instance(s) are launched using the service image by an autoscaling group specific to service instances, and autoscaling will re-launch them if they get terminated. They handle imaging and load balancing tasks. (How many are running on what hosts depends on the configuration of its autoscaling group, not important here.) \r\n\r\nWe've discovered during upgrade testing that you need to disable (terminate and prevent from re-starting) all service instances before packing your instances on an NC, and keep them disabled until the NC is fully upgraded to RHEL7 and its instances have been unpacked, so it's ready to be registered back into the cloud. \r\n\r\nA service instance should not be packed and unpacked. If you do, you can end up in a situation where a service instance is running as an orphan (will never be used), and sometimes doesn't show up in the list of instances (\"euca-describe-instances verbose\" only; the eucaconsole never lists service instances). A new service instance will be created and used, even though this orphan is still running.\r\n\r\nAlso, you need to disable service instances while you're upgrading the non-NC hosts, otherwise the existing instances running on the NCs will be left behind as orphans and new ones created when the non-NCs come back up, same as above.\r\n\r\nThis is independent of the section \"About Auto Scaling During Upgrade\". Leave that untouched. Even if people disable autoscaling, the existing service instances will keep running, and they must be terminated following the process below. \r\n\r\n*Add this new step as the first step in the packing process (before \"Change the state of the NC...\"), and also as the first step in the Upgrade Non-NC page:*\r\n\r\n1. Disable the internal service instances until packing is completed. _(next sentence on the NC page only)_ Note that this will disable them on all hosts, not just the NC you are packing instances on.\r\n* Terminate all service instances and prevent autoscaling from re-starting them during the packing process:\r\n{noformat}\r\nesi-manage-stack -a delete imaging\r\n{noformat}\r\n* Verify that service instances are disabled:\r\n{noformat}\r\neuctl services.imaging.worker.configured\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe output should show \"false\".\r\n* Wait for the service instances to terminate. There should be no output from the command:\r\n{noformat}\r\neuca-describe-instances verbose | grep euca-internal-imaging-service | grep -v terminated\r\n{noformat}\r\n* If the service instances do not terminate after 5 minutes, terminate them using their instance IDs, e.g.:\r\n{noformat}\r\neuca-terminate-instances i-182b5376 i-5810b164\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\n*Add this as the last step in the unpacking process (after \"Verify that the instance is running and the destination NC started.\"), and also as the last step in the Upgrade Non-NC page (after \"Verify that the clean installs worked...\"):*\r\n\r\nRe-enable running the internal service instances.\r\n* Set the property that will enable service instances to run, and cause autoscaling to launch the appropriate number of instances on the appropriate hosts.\r\n{noformat}\r\nesi-manage-stack -a create imaging\r\n{noformat}\r\n* Verify that service instances are enabled:\r\n{noformat}\r\neuctl services.imaging.worker.configured\r\n{noformat}\r\nThe output should show \"true\".\r\n* You can verify that they have started by watching for instances to be created (the \"pending\" state) and go into the \"running\" state.\r\n{noformat}\r\neuca-describe-instances verbose | grep euca-internal-imaging-service | grep -v

Thanks.\r\n\r\nYes, the \"grep -v terminated\" is correct in all cases. When watching for no more running instances, it says to watch for no output (it filters out terminated instances). When watching for running instances, it still filters out terminated, because those instances terminated earlier can hang around the output for a while, saying \"terminated\". We don't want that to confuse, when watching for running ones instead.\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lincoln.thomas","name":"lincoln.thomas","key":"lincoln.thomas","accountId":"557058:f9364c00-87ee-4948-b657-bb8f8f2030ea","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c21bba9797b880c34a5d772e6db4664f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlincoln.thomas%26avatarId%3D17800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Lincoln Thomas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-17T19:01:12.188-0500","updated":"2016-09-17T19:01:12.188-0500"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/DOC-1944/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
