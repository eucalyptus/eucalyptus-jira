Files\r\nThe purpose of this wiki page is to describe the copyright notice/header that should be applied to all HOS HP proprietary source code.\r\n\r\nCopyright Notice for HPE Helion Proprietary and Open Source  Files\r\nThe Copyright notice\r\nFile types to be considered for Copyright and License Notification\r\nWhere to put the Copyright Notice\r\nWhen to modify the Copyright Notice\r\nExample Copyrights\r\nExample 1:  Software first published in 2016 with proprietary HPE license notification (for proprietary HPE files only)\r\nExample 1a:  Software first published in 2016 with Apache license notification\r\nExample 2:   Software published in 2014 and modified in 2015 and 2016 with proprietary HPE license notification (for proprietary HPE files only)\r\nExample 2a:  Software published in 2015 and modified in 2016 with Apache license notification\r\nReferences\r\nHere is the new HPE copyright info .  That info should probably be incorporated into this wiki page.\r\n\r\nThe Copyright notice\r\nThe copyright notice is comprised of two parts\r\n\r\nThe copyright - indicates the date(s) and company that holds the copyright\r\nThe license notification  - indicates what license applies.  i.e.,, Apache GPL or proprietary\r\nFile types to be considered for Copyright and License Notification\r\nIn general, any file that HP would have a copyright interest in should have the copyright notice in it.  In most cases this would be source code files, but it also may be other file types.  The below list are several file types but should not be considered inclusive:\r\n\r\nfiles that contain statements using a programming language file (python, java, c++, ansible, yaml, json, jinja2, etc.)\r\ntemplate files\r\nconfig files .\r\nhtml\r\nany scripting language (i.e., javascript, bash, ksh, csh)\r\nExamples\r\n\tJ2 files\r\nThe .j2 files are source files that ultimately generate the upstream data and configuration files. It is desirable to have the copyright and license notification into the .j2 file but not in the resulting .ini or .conf file. To prevent the generation of the copyright and license notification in the generated files the { } syntax will suppress the output of the line.\r\n\r\nThis example is shown with the HPE proprietary license notification in a new file.\r\n\r\n{ © Copyright 2016 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development Company LP }\r\n{ Confidential computer software.

Consistent with FAR 12.211 and 12.212, Commercial Computer Software, Computer Software Documentation, and Technical Data for Commercial Items are licensed }\r\n{ to the U.S. Government under vendor's standard commercial license. }\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n What does not require a Copyright or License Notification\r\n\r\nAny text or file that is written or created by a tool or process (i.e., the file can be regenerated at any time)\r\nA binary file \r\nCompiled files should get the copyright via the source code during the compilation process\r\nWhere to put the Copyright Notice\r\nThe copyright notice should be included in those files where HP has a copyright interest (e.g., new files or where modifications are made).  In general, the guidance is that the copyright notice should be placed on the first line of all source files that are visible to the user (or above any other existing copyright notices).  Do not remove existing copyright notices The top of the file placement is preferable to ensure that users have a reasonable notice of the claim of the copyright.  This applies to all files that are laid down as part of the product install, regardless of their use.\r\n\r\nGuidance:\r\n\r\nIf only minor changes are being made in the file, the HPE copyright  does not need to be modified or added.  If more invasive changes are being made the copyright should be modified or added.\r\nThe license notification should always be added to any source code file or other files as described above.  Only one license notification should be present in the file.  Openstack files use the Apache notification (see below)\r\nFor additional details reference the  HP Copyright Guide\r\n\r\nWhen to modify the Copyright Notice\r\nWhen do I...\r\n \r\nModify only the Copyright when these conditions are met\t\r\nThe source code file contains an existing copyright and header AND modifications were made to the file. Update the copyright year(s) if the modification year is different that the currently stated copyright year and if the license header remains the same. See Example 2.\r\nAdd/Modify the Copyright and Header when these conditions are met\t\r\nNew HP proprietary source code file. See Example 1.\r\nHP proprietary source code file is being pushed upstream (replace HP proprietary license with the appropriate license (for OpenStack this will be the Apache header). See Example 3.\r\nNot make any changes\t\r\nSource code file was not modified\r\nModification was made to the source code file in the same year as stated in the copyright\r\nFile is a generated file that can be recreated\r\nFile is a system (i.e., Linux) file\r\nExample Copyrights\r\nExample 1:  Software first published in 2016 with proprietary HPE license notification (for proprietary HPE files only)\r\n© Copyright 2016 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development Company LP \r\n \r\nConfidential computer software.
