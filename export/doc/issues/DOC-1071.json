For instance, If you already ha ELB enabled (image installed) on 3.3.x then there is nothing you \"must\" do post upgrade for ELB support. However, along with 3.4 we have released an updated load balancer image that contains many bugfixes.  So, if you are coming from 3.3.x and already had ELB enabled you just need to do euca-install-loadbalancer.  The command will install the current image and set it as the load balancer image to use.  The old image is still registered and in S3. There are other euca-install-load-balancer commands that can remove old versions and/or switch versions. Any existing Load Balancer that may be running at time of upgrade will still be the old image. New load balancers will use the new image.\r\n\r\nHowever, If you are coming from a version pre-elb or did not have elb enabled on 3.3.x then after installing the load balancer image you should get new creds so the load balancer endpoint is defined. I hope this helps. Let me know if you need more clarification or if I misunderstood the question

balancing enabled on 3.3.x, then there is nothing you “must\" do post upgrade for load balancing support. However,  the 3.4 release of Eucalyptus includes an updated load balancer image that contains many bugfixes. If you are coming from 3.3.x and already had ELB enabled, you need to run euca-install-loadbalancer after the upgrade. The command will install the current image and set it as the default load balancer image, and all new load balancers will use the new image. The old image is still registered and in S3, and any existing load balancer that may be running at the time of upgrade will still use the old image.  If you are coming from a version of Eucalyptus that did not have the load balancing feature, or did not have load balancing enabled on 3.3.x, then after installing the load balancer image you should get new credentials so the load balancer endpoint is defined.\"","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=scottb","name":"scottb","key":"scottb","accountId":"557058:8b784f3d-4aba-42f1-a016-d04e8269968b","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/6a93de6d1d4b0053831945571f8ca4e6?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dscottb%26avatarId%3D12701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Scott Butler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-10T16:00:17.477-0600","updated":"2013-12-10T16:00:17.477-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/25107/comment/59481","id":"59481","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tony","name":"tony","key":"tony","accountId":"557058:353956db-b78c-4f3b-9096-f8f58e6709c8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/14ec1b18e630cc0743492fc327a12df7?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtony%26avatarId%3D16600%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tony Beckham","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"[~scottb], looks good.
