Duplicate ContentWe are seeing duplicate content from your site. Some related to the blog but most relating to the docs section of the site. Here are some examples:* /docs/3.2/ag/access_initial_setup.html    * /docs/3.1/aq/access_initial_setup.html* /docs/3.2/ag/access_polextens.html    * /docs/3.1/ag/access_polextens.htmlSearch engines are seeing these groups of pages duplicates. This can be fixed by using a canonical tag that will let engines know these pages are duplicates or slight variations of the primary page.Example:In the header of the pages in question, place this tag with the primary URL as the href.i.e. for this page,    /docs/3.1/ag/access_initial_setup.htmlAdd this Tag:<link rel="canonical" href="http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs/latest/ag/access_initial_setup.html" />This tag should go in the header on the page below so it remains present on the site (unlike a 301) but are not seen by Google as duplicates.
