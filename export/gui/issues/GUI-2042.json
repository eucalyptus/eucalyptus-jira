This appears to be why you removed the functionality in in [GUI-1658]\r\n** For this reason, perhaps it would better to remove the size of the instance type when using an EBS volume to make it less confusing to the user\r\n* For Instance-store images, the Amazon API has no reference to the size of the image in S3.  The image information must first be gathered from the manifest in S3 for the image, and then the value determined for the root partition size.\r\n** This is the tricky part to implement.  You need to call a function to get the size of the image in S3 since the 'desribe-images' API doesn't implement this for instance-store images.\r\n** Also note that with instance-store images, the delta between the root image size and vmtype size is added as a separate volume to the running instance (i.e. /dev/vdb)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jgallucci32","name":"jgallucci32","key":"jgallucci32","accountId":"557058:1cd98ee4-b2ee-4683-a315-2a6abd75b048","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"John Gallucci","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-09-21T19:34:31.684-0500","updated":"2015-09-21T19:34:31.684-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/38259/comment/92158","id":"92158","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Hi [~jgallucci32], after discussion, I have some info to share.\r\nFor ELB images, the root size is determined by the block device mapping, so by snapshot size, or overridden at run time.
