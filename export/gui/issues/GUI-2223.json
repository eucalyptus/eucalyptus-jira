been testing the demo scripts in the euca-demo project against an 8-node manual build of 4.2. I was able to run my demo-20 simple stack with no trouble (so I don't think I tried to view stack status inside the console), but I'm having some trouble running the demo-30 wordpress workload repatriation demo. Not only am I seeing trouble with running cloudinit within the demo instance (this worked in 4.1.0, 4.1.1, 4.1.2), when I attempted to go into the console to check on status of the stack, via this URL: https://console.hp-gol01-d8.mjc.prc.eucalyptus-systems.com/stacks/WordPressDemoStack, I get a \"failed to open page\" result.\r\n\r\nViewing the eucaconsole.log, I see many lines like this:\r\n2015-11-09 20:48:25 ERROR demo/admin@10.5.1.106 [iBVVRSLWACLz3lQg]: The specified bucket does not exist\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what bucket it's looking for. I have created a \"sample-templates\" bucket in the eucalyptus account, but I have not uncommented the line in console.ini which would enable this. I do not have a sample-templates bucket in the demo account where I'm attempting to run this demo.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed this problem when running the default Nginx proxy, as well as the replacement proxy I have been using instead which handles both the console and UFS via multiple virtual hosts.\r\n\r\nSince I've been using my own proxy config, the console.ini has been modified to specify my own PK and CERT:\r\nsession.secure = true\r\nsslcert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/star.hp-gol01-d8.mjc.prc.eucalyptus-systems.com.crt\r\nsslkey=/etc/pki/tls/private/star.hp-gol01-d8.mjc.prc.eucalyptus-systems.com.key\r\n\r\nBut I have not otherwise modified it from the default.\r\n\r\nThe console is sporadically available from https://console.hp-gol01-d8.mjc.prc.eucalyptus-systems.com/, but I am currently rebuilding this often to test changes to 4.2 manual install scripts, so let me know if you want to take a look and I can make sure it's stable.

this seems to have fixed the problem.\r\n*   [^demo-20-cfn-simple-20151116.log] - David was concerned that creating the stack via Euca2ools was not creating some bucket needed, this is a log showing me running the \"initialize\", \"run\" (portion run live in front of demo audience) and \"reset\" scripts for my demo-20, which creates a simple cloud formation stack, which worked perfectly this time. I was able to view the stack while being created in the Stack list page, click on the stack and view all 3 tabs of the stack detail. I could view the template which was created. While the stack was being deleted, I could see it in the list page in deleted status, and go into detail and view events, the template, etc.\r\n\r\nSo, at least for this simple template, all looks good now, changing the upfhost from localhost to FQDN seems to have fixed it.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, please confirm that a new install doesn't have some dependency on a bucket, based on what David suspected, which was satisfied by something he or I did to manually create a stack via the Console. If that is not done, and the first stack created is via Euca2ools, would there be some bucket missing?  I can re-create this PRC 8-node manual system again late tonight, if you want to try this on a fresh install tomorrow, just LMK and I can try and send results.\r\n\r\nI'm about to try my WordPress demo, which create a much more complex Stack, this has been failing to signal with cfn-signal when it successfully completes. That's a separate bug, however...
