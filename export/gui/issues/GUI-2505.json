When creating an alarm there, ensure the metrics list includes all relevant metrics for the given resource rather than only a subset of the list (as seen on the metrics landing page).  See https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucaconsole/blob/master/eucaconsole/constants/cloudwatch.py#L34-L71 for the definitive list of metrics choices based on the namespace.  Creating an alarm for an instance should display the metric choices for the AWS/EC2 namespace, in addition to any custom metrics for that resource (note that custom metrics are tracked in a distinct story).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-07-14T00:23:54.377-0500","updated":"2016-07-14T00:23:54.377-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/41902/comment/108363","id":"108363","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lbiasi","name":"lbiasi","key":"lbiasi","accountId":"557058:daaebf52-3713-4e4f-a29b-79f55aed32c9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Leslie Biasi","active":false,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"body":"4.3.0 Released 8/9/2016","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=lbiasi","name":"lbiasi","key":"lbiasi","accountId":"557058:daaebf52-3713-4e4f-a29b-79f55aed32c9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3d92822583af436915b8264dbff0d30a?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dlbiasi%26avatarId%3D15002%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Leslie Biasi","active":false,"timeZone":"US/Central"},"created":"2016-08-12T20:04:15.813-0500","updated":"2016-08-12T20:04:15.813-0500"}],"maxResults":22,"total":22,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
