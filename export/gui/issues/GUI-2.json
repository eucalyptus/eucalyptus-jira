We now have public (shared) caches for public and amazon images. Those don't start populating until somebody logs in with AWS creds. Each time somebody logs in with AWS, their session creds are passed off to the code managing these shared caches so that if we need to refresh these caches, we have (hopefully) valid credentials to use. In some cases, those credentials expire and the threads will still run and try to refresh (every 20 minutes per config setting).\r\n\r\nIt isn't clear to me if you are simply seeing a lot of retries in boto, but either way, it's harmless.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-10-16T13:00:47.336-0500","updated":"2013-10-16T13:00:47.336-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/24643/comment/66252","id":"66252","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tjcramer","name":"tjcramer","key":"tjcramer","accountId":"557058:e076cf45-80ca-4b67-befb-7b0c21f32739","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tim Cramer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~alice], please let us know if this is still an issue with 4.0.0","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=tjcramer","name":"tjcramer","key":"tjcramer","accountId":"557058:e076cf45-80ca-4b67-befb-7b0c21f32739","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/65e7a5c18fc469f1978f6367993c3bf0?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dtjcramer%26avatarId%3D10401%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Tim Cramer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-07T15:34:33.341-0500","updated":"2014-04-07T15:34:33.341-0500"}],"maxResults":13,"total":13,"startAt":0},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
