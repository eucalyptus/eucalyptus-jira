Pls try running package built from master last night (since I merged this branch yesterday). On OSX, run FF and navigate to an ELB detail page. by default, it will show the graphs. Leave the browser on this page and see if your laptop's fans start running after several minutes. If so, you can verify that FF is the culprit via the Activity Monitor. I found once I navigate away, the load goes down, but FF is bound to kill the CPU a short time later when using the console.\r\nNOTE: I started noticing the fan going on in 2 minutes on my brand new MBP.
