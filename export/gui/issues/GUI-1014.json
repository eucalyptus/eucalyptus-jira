Expectation is that terminated instances should clear within one minute of being terminated. Landing page may need to be refreshed manually. since terminated is not considered a transitional state. If this isn't good enough, we could add terminated to the list of transitional states so that this will auto-refresh.

However when I click through, the list is empty. This is when I went to confirm via the CLI. euca-describe-instances returns 1 line with a terminated status. If I then re-delete the terminated instance, so that euca-describe-instances returns empty, then the dashboard tile and it’s resulting list screen both show 0.\r\n\r\nIt seems the tile is using a query which does not exclude instances in the terminated state, but the list behind it does exclude them.
