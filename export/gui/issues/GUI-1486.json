Some comments below...\r\n\r\nI realized when UX reviewing this that we could be more helpful, with some help bubbles on the select certs dialog. I added two to the wireframe, for the private and public key labels. :)\r\n\r\nI can't review the behavior when there is an existing cert on the cloud because there don't seem to be any. Can you put one on there so I can review this? I assume you've created some in development of this feature. Thanks!\r\n\r\nWhen no existing certs, that widget and associated label should not display. Instead, we should A) replace that widget and label with text that says \"No certificates are available. Please upload a new certificate instead.\"  B) Default the radio button to the other one. Updated wireframe.\r\n\r\nI added some gobbeldygook on the back end certs and clicked add cert, and it didn't give me an error, and the \"Select\" link on the listener panel didn't update like it should. Can you look into this and see what's up? \r\n\r\nI pushed some minor text fixes to your feature branch, FYI. Might wanna pull. :)
