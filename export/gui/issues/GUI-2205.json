A few small things need fixing and then we should be good (new punchlist):\r\n\r\n* Primary disabled buttons get an outline on hover, but shouldn't (screenshot attached)\r\n* select buttons in image picker for launch wizards hover outline seems to be chopping off the last pixel or two on the bottom (screenshot attached)\r\n* same problem with the \"next\" buttons on wizards, but there it's the top that is getting chopped (screenshot attached)\r\n* security group rules editor: tabs look great but the gray line below them extends all the way across the dialog, which makes it visually indistinguishable from an HR section separator. Can it only extend as far as the tabs perhaps? (screenshot attached)\r\n* security group rules editor: use my IP and open to all IPs links should stay hpe green on hover, and get an underline. they appear to darken instead. All links should stay green on hover and get an underline. I thought I had set that style universally but it appears to be different in this spot. \r\n\r\nI think once those are fixed we should be GTG on this ticket.
