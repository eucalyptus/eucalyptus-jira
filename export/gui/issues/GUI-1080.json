I can imagine exceptional circumstances where files could be left behind (maybe a user clicks a link after they make a request which generates a file and the file never gets downloaded). I can think of remediation measures that would make this almost a non-issue.\r\n- only allow 1 file per session, so any subsequent downloads would overwrite the previous (if it wasn't already deleted)\r\n- maybe only allow 1 file per user, so another session would clean up for a previous one. Could have implications if a user id was shared between people.\r\n- perform cleanup of these temp files when the console starts\r\n- perform cleanup if we detect a session has ended on the server side.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-07-08T16:06:52.545-0500","updated":"2014-07-08T16:06:52.545-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/30828/comment/73515","id":"73515","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=rusvika","name":"rusvika","key":"rusvika","accountId":"557058:0f138bdf-f1d0-4468-9edd-e45575af47da","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c975ce5391bf03e1a9aa2a957435569b?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Drusvika%26avatarId%3D10701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c975ce5391bf03e1a9aa2a957435569b?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Drusvika%26avatarId%3D10701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c975ce5391bf03e1a9aa2a957435569b?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Drusvika%26avatarId%3D10701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/c975ce5391bf03e1a9aa2a957435569b?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Drusvika%26avatarId%3D10701%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Vika Felmetsger","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I see what you mean.

That means allowing multiple files per user/session. That would let us fire off timers and not have to track them at all. If they expire, the file is removed for sure.
