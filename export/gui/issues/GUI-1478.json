not working [FIXED]\r\n- Gear icons on dashboard have an unwanted border and drop-down caret [FIXED]\r\n- Gear icons on landing pages have an unwanted border and drop-down caret [FIXED]\r\n- Buttons have an unwanted border [FIXED]\r\n- User detail page white background no longer wraps main content (for all tabs) [FIXED]\r\n- Min/desired/max form labels are behind the inputs on the scaling group detail page and create scaling group wizard [FIXED]\r\n- The \"Add a scaling policy\" tile on the scaling group policy page isn't centered [FIXED]\r\n- The \"Attach a volume\" tile on the instance volumes page isn't centered [FIXED]\r\n- The \"Create a snapshot\" tile on the volume snapshots page isn't centered [FIXED]\r\n- There is too much spacing below the labels in the summary section of the wizards [FIXED]\r\n- The select buttons in the image picker in the launch instance and launch config wizards have an unwanted border, color, and text wrapping [FIXED]\r\n- Other primary and secondary buttons have an unwanted border [FIXED]\r\n- There is too little spacing below the form labels on the login and change password pages [FIXED]\r\n- There is too little padding around the form on the login page [FIXED]\r\n\r\nBroken features:\r\n- Selecting an image in the create/launch wizard image picker throws a \"TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluating 'a.getAttribute(b)')\" error in the JS console\r\n- The list of instances in the Attach volume dialog is missing when dialog is launched from the volumes landing page. [FIXED]\r\n- The IP addresses chosen widget in the Attach IP address dialog on the instance detail page is broken [FIXED]\r\n- The dialogs on the launch instance and create launch config wizards aren't properly reset when subsequently opened.

[FIXED]\r\n- The initial values aren't properly set in the Create Alarm dialog for scaling group policies. [FIXED]\r\n\r\nHEADS UP:\r\n- Foundation 5.5 requires Sass 3.4 and Compass 1.0.
