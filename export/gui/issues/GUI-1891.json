But based on the inputs received from QA team it appears the same policy that works on AWS to allow only access to the AWS console does not work on Euca. If you use that policy it will log you out immediately from Euca Console. This is feedback from Jan 2015 by [~ccassler].\r\n \r\nThe policy here doesn’t work on Eucalyptus, you will get logged out immediately if you attempt to log in:\r\n \r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n  \"Statement\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"Sid\": \"Stmt1422554446380\",\r\n      \"Action\": [\r\n        \"iam:GetLoginProfile\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis policy you mentioned  here does get you logged in to Eucalyptus limited to EC2:\r\n \r\n{code}\r\n{\r\n  \"Statement\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"Sid\": \"Stmt1422461240537\",\r\n      \"Action\": [\r\n        \"iam:GetLoginProfile\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"Sid\": \"Stmt1422462580858\",\r\n      \"Action\": \"ec2:*\",\r\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\r\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dshekhawat","name":"dshekhawat","key":"dshekhawat","accountId":"557058:dc10d216-39f8-4d84-a5ff-7d4daf8a44ed","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7cda271db1cec24c198fdfb42ec8a8ae?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddshekhawat%26avatarId%3D15400%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Deependra Shekhawat","active":false,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-09-03T21:18:12.612-0500","updated":"2015-09-03T21:18:12.612-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/37338/comment/91252","id":"91252","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Let's consider differences in the aws and euca consoles.\r\nAWS does*NOT* dump a user into a screen that shows resource information (perhaps on purpose).
