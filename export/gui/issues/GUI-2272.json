When I selected on the select-all checkbox, the row checkbox changed to selected on. Cool. But when I selected-off the row checkbox, the select-all checkbox continued to stay checked on (see attachments).\r\n\r\nCan you change the code so when (1) the select-all checkbox is selected on (the row checkboxes get selected on), and (2) a row checkbox is selected off, then (3) the select-all checkbox is selected off?\r\n\r\n !Elastic IP addresses - Select all.png|thumbnail!  !Elastic IP addresses - deselect row checkbox.png|thumbnail!

I have some concerns, specifically around the button for the actions not always displaying but only popping up when something is checked, whether the area that contains the button is fixed to prevent the user from not seeing it when the list is scrolled down so items can be checked, and the enablement/disablement of list items in the menu. We may need to rethink/redesign the UX around this functionality. \r\n\r\nKicking back to to-do just so we can discuss this and it doesn't go to QA like this. \r\n\r\nCC: [~lnajjar]","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jloza","name":"jloza","key":"jloza","accountId":"557058:a300fccb-c87c-4e2e-88b5-de2013c0846e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jenny Loza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-01-04T10:22:42.633-0600","updated":"2016-01-04T10:22:42.633-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/39518/comment/97520","id":"97520","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The show/hide button behavior was changed to a disabled/enabled state based on item selection.
