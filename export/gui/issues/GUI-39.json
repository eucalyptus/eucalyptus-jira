Please note that this information is available in the expandos.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jloza","name":"jloza","key":"jloza","accountId":"557058:a300fccb-c87c-4e2e-88b5-de2013c0846e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jenny Loza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-08-30T11:26:51.285-0500","updated":"2013-08-30T11:26:51.285-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/23575/comment/64199","id":"64199","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jloza","name":"jloza","key":"jloza","accountId":"557058:a300fccb-c87c-4e2e-88b5-de2013c0846e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jenny Loza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"[~tjcramer], nope, we've already removed private IP.
