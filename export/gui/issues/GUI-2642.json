http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2011/10/01/thoughts-on-beaker/\r\n\r\nNamely:\r\n\"Then when users started combining the memcached backend with HTTP sessions, all kinds of new issues occurred, namely that any particular key might be removed from memcached at any time\"\r\nThe implication of this is that we can't trust a value to remain in memcached even before it is set to expire. The reason for that is due to size limitations. To explain more, memcached has size limits (it's all in memory) and if we stored enough data in there, some older stuff would be dumped. In some situations, that could be data from a user session, and that would have the side effect of expiring that user's session prematurely, which we ought to avoid at all costs.\r\nThere is other good information in there about the history and state of the beaker code. Sadly, today, 5 years after the post was written, there aren't other good alternatives to the session stuff. Caching yes, but not sessions. \r\n\"What I'm getting at here is that I'm not super-interested in most of what Beaker has - a lot of the APIs are awkward, all of the storage backends are either mostly useless or slow and crufty, and I don't care much for the server-side session thing especially using backends that were designed for caching. Overall Beaker creates a coarse opacity on top of a collection of things that I think good application developers should be much more aware of. I really think developers should know how their tools work.\"","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2016-06-10T10:06:50.283-0500","updated":"2016-06-10T10:17:58.388-0500"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/GUI-2642/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
