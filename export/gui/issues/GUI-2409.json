Only Firefox seems to allow the option group labels to be styled.  Let me know if you'd like those styled anyway -- although it seems odd to only have the styles applied in one browser, so I'd vote to not modify those styles.\r\n\r\n2. Due to the way we're building the metric options via Angular's ng-options, we're stuck with either *always* displaying the metrics grouped by namespace, or not grouping them at all.  Note that custom metrics have custom namespaces, so I'd vote we always show the metrics grouped by the namespace label.  If a customer creates two custom metrics with the same name but in different namespaces, not showing the namespace would display the \"same\" custom metrics twice if we don't always display the namespace label, and grouping the metrics by the namespace label would remove that confusion.  See the two screenshots I attached to this ticket to understand what I'm getting at.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-04-13T16:36:58.423-0500","updated":"2016-04-13T16:36:58.423-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/40614/comment/101421","id":"101421","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jloza","name":"jloza","key":"jloza","accountId":"557058:a300fccb-c87c-4e2e-88b5-de2013c0846e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jenny Loza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"hi [~kgill] I use Chrome and the CF labels were styled in Chrome.

By far the most common use cases for scaling group alarms are for the instance and elb metrics, the others are outliers and we can greatly simplify the experience for the majority of users by using this dialog in both places, and allowing users to set the less common scaling actions from resources outside the scaling group from the resource detail pages now. \r\n\r\nGreat job!

The dialog defaults to the ASG dimensions, which are fine when a scaling group doesn't have an ELB.  However, when an ELB is present the dimensions should be set to the ASG only when an EC2 metric is selected (e.g. CPUUtilization for all instances in the ASG).  If the ASG has an ELB and an ELB metric is selected, the alarm (and scaling policy) will fail as the ASG dimension is incorrect.  We ran into this issue in GUI-2126 (fixed in 4.2 in the old create alarm dialog), and it will resurface unless we handle this better in the new create alarm dialog.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-04-15T18:33:06.401-0500","updated":"2016-04-15T18:33:49.284-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/40614/comment/101524","id":"101524","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~jloza]: OK, I think I fixed the broken namespace and dimensions issues in the create alarm dialog for an ASG with an ELB when launched from the scaling group monitoring or create scaling policy page, preventing GUI-2126 from resurfacing AFAICT.
