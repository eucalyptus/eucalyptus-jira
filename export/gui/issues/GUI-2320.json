The More Actions button/dropdown should be disabled unless at least one item is selected\r\n2. Only the following items in the More Actions drop-down menu should be enabled when 2 or more items are selected: Stop, Start, Reboot, Terminate, Disassociate IP address.\r\n3. The following actions redirect to other pages instead of opening a dialog: View details (goes to General tab), Manage volumes, View monitoring, Launch more like this, Create scaling group launch configuration, Create image\r\n\r\n2. All menu items should be enabled when one item is selected except the following cases:\r\n  - The \"Stop\" action should be disabled except for an EBS-backed instance in the \"running\" state\r\n  - The \"Start\" action should be disabled except for an EBS-backed instance in the \"stopped\" state\r\n  - The \"Disassociate IP address\" action should be disabled unless a running instance has an associated elastic IP address (elastic IPs have hyperlinks).\r\n  - The following actions should be disabled for a stopped instance: Connect to instance, View console output, Associate/disassociate IP
