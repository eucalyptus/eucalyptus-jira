To better adhere to AngularJS MVC patterns and to allow for better code reuse, it has been proposed that we migrate our embedded XHR calls into shared AngularJS services.\r\n\r\n* Identify embedded XHR ($http) calls and organize them into logical groupings.\r\n* Implement services.\r\n* Tests.\r\n* Replace embedded XHR calls with service calls.\r\n\r\nI would recommend a few guidelines:\r\n\r\n* Services may be organized by page function for starters.\r\n* Service calls should return promises.  This allows us to implement basic response handling within the service while also allowing users of the service to provide handlers to both errors and successes.\r\n* Use the injector pattern when implementing services.  We may just want to minify some day.\r\n* Each submitted service should have a corresponding test.
