Note that when the security group create function as a modal box we currently lose the ability to flag incomplete forms to the user, resulting in a sub-par and inconsistent user experience. A separate bug has been filed to see if we can address that for create alarm and copy alarm in the current implementation as dialogs, so that the validation ticket could move into QA. \r\n\r\nI am sure everyone is aware that tickets are written ***at any time in the development cycle*** to document issues, and are not assigned to a release until (or sometimes even much after) they are scrubbed. This ticket documents a very clear inconsistency in our UI. Of course it will be work to refactor it in the places where that is appropriate, and, obviously, well into QA sprints in the current release is not the time to do that work. Please do not conflate when a ticket should land with whether a ticket should exist.
