Nginx is used as an SSL reverse-proxy in front of eucaconsole, this is not detected in the object details page when a link to the object is created and displayed.\r\n\r\nI discovered this problem on one of the two systems created for Discover, which now have such Nginx reverse proxies in front of them with SSL certificates signed by the HP Cloud CA hierarchy, when I was testing a CFN template I uploaded to the \"sample-templates\" bucket.\r\n\r\nThe URL through which I reached the object is:\r\nhttps://console.hp-aw2-1.hpcloudsvc.com/buckets/sample-templates/itemdetails/WordPress_Single_Instance_Eucalyptus.template\r\n\r\nIn the body of the page at this URL, there is an object Link with text:\r\nhttps://objectstorage.hp-aw2-1.hpcloudsvc.com:8773/sample-templates/WordPress_Single_Instance_Eucalyptus.template\r\nand value:\r\nhttps://objectstorage.hp-aw2-1.hpcloudsvc.com:8773/sample-templates/WordPress_Single_Instance_Eucalyptus.template?Signature=HyovDqI8xuqgsbZiQpw%2BpU8lvzw%3D&Expires=1435038592&AWSAccessKeyId=AKIK7HVYG4NXSVATOI2A&x-amz-security-token=ZXVjYQAB6M%2BCLqwJZqbJBEadxrucK0J8G%2BZPsAadffinj0mxyI3L3LkoJ5piPzhletiXDtACW0vrMy22%2BuG0VRTOmuQicoXagw6ZfqAJZgY16ufRnWhO/RtWMW/EuQOWWmxhd5MXNPaVb0XJwCwRSuuio4xyBGfoXTT/0l7fD/lr/EvAH8a4EkmkdIHH01fUPmnmD4XXVYeux/ZL5W3L0DFJPT9G/E6KJP2HbxPVj29yn5adYBJ/XbDG7eK1hoA%3D\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the code correctly detects that https is in place (session.secure = true in console.ini), but does not detect that the reverse proxy is stripping off the \":8773\" as it listens on the normal SSL port of 443\r\n\r\nExpected behavior would be for the Links to be the same except with no port, and for them to work when clicked on, with the return path again going through the proxy.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to detect if a proxy is in place by examination of the headers, as the proxy is setting Host and X-Forwarded-For.\r\n\r\nNote this is running the version of the console used for the Discover demos,

see, it was just to show you how I think (IMHO) my reverse-proxy method is an improvement over the prior method (supports both console and UFS on one IP, more standard method of using upstream and separate server config files seen where many virtual hosts are centralized into one set of proxies in a DMZ, etc.) So, unless you're curious, may not be relevant to this bug. I'd just want to test any fix against this when it does come out before it's closed.\r\n\r\nThe effect until this is fixed, is users can't successfully click on the links for S3 bucket objects, as those do include the https scheme, but don't strip off the unnecessary :8773 port. However, as a workaround, they can just copy and paste the link, removing the port manually, and I think this works even with the security token. And, any proxy access to the object via euca2ools S3 API or AWS CLI works. So, more of a usability hassle than a blocker.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have this fixed in 4.2.1 though...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-07-06T14:39:33.020-0500","updated":"2015-07-06T14:39:33.020-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/36808/comment/89241","id":"89241","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~jloza] and [~dkavanagh] Given that you've raised this to major, I will again offer to demo the newer method I've developed to use Nginx for SSL on both the Console and UFS on the same single Public IP address.

So, even if the https + :8773 variant works for you, that's not the correct path, and it really should not work - it can't be going through the proxy, as the proxy is not listening on that port.

In my experience designing and implementing websites which have often needed PCI compliance, I wind up with a dedicated reverse-proxy which runs directly on the app server providing a service, associated with a private IP address via split-brain DNS for internal users, as well as a shared reverse-proxy setup on a farm of web/proxy servers running in a DMZ, associated with a public DNS for external users. The external proxies are the focus of most security efforts, including the firewalls which exists between the internet and the DMZ, and the DMZ and internal networks. We usually want to limit what gets into the external firewall, software firewall running on the DMZ-based external proxy and the internal firewall, to only 80 and 443, so we're sure all traffic can only enter and leave via this proxy via paths known by the firewalls, which are usually scanning the traffic on those known ports for attacks.\r\n\r\nIf we are to create clouds which can be exposed to the internet yet pass a security audit for larger corporations that have seen what's been happening with hackers lately, I think we MUST support this type of DMZ-based reverse proxy so our servers do not have to be placed in the DMZ. This is PCI 101 - the most basic requirement.  This means that any URLs we display on pages should be proxy-aware. I'm just removing the port because my proxy listens on the standard port. But, Nginx allows for much more sophisticated url rewriting during the proxy - it would be nice to at least allow for removal of the port, but ideally the code would look at the HTTP request headers, which will include proxy headers that show the URL with which the user reached the proxy, so that it can use that to construct self-referential URLs which again will work through the proxy. If there's another method, all ears. I'm OK with a console.ini value which allows the user to override the base URL so you just prepend that to whatever PATH value you want, if auto-discovery of this via headers is difficult.\r\n\r\nOn your last point, I don't know boto well enough to know how that might work. It seems like you're saying you're using boto's generate_url() function to construct the URL for the S3 link, which you don't modify further. Seems like that flag would change the generated URL to start with http://... but not do anything about the :8773 port, which is moving in the opposite direction of correct behavior to me.\r\n\r\nIf there's some way to indicate that UFS is running on a port other than 8773, so boto returns an URL which does not include the :port when http and 80 or https and 443, that might work. But, I think that if there's some way to do what I suggested above, lookup, or have as a config parameter, the URL's \"scheme:://domain/\" prefix for self-referential URLs, that would always result in correct behavior, regardless of proxy.\r\n\r\nOne last point. I've assumed that to minimize the risk of the proxy causing problems, I wanted to allow for all \"inter-Euca\" communication to occur on normal ports, oblivious to the proxy. It's only external users that may go through this, either on a DMZ, or on a co-resident proxy on the CLC itself, both for API and console. This allows me to use firewall rules on hardware or software (iptables) to restrict all subnets except Euca's own public/management/private subnets to only go through the proxy. I wouldn't want to lose this concept with any solution. There should just be a method to have self-referential URLs use the same prefix as the user did when reaching the console via the proxy - this should not, ideally, change how the console obtains it's information from UFS or directly from the CLC - that communication path should NOT go through the proxy, as it introduces non-predictable and untested behavior - we can't test all the proxy configs companies may want to use.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael

It's easier to configure and more efficient, when we configure SSL on a reverse proxy in front of Java applications, in my experience. C-code speed, simpler. shared config with rest of OS. Java SSL sucks too.\r\n\r\nI'm hesitant to have the console go through a relatively new and untested component, in that I think all Euca components are tested most with direct connections, the proxy config - for it to be most flexible for actual large client scenarios - needs to be flexible to handle what may be existing reverse-proxy setups which we leverage, meaning we can't always specify our own, so this introduces a bit of risk.\r\n\r\nBut, that said, if the easiest way to have the console's self-referential URLs correctly represent the proxy base url is to do this, I can see that if we consider the console as just an add-on tool which puts a GUI in front of the API, then having it hit the API via the same via-proxy method as we're setting things up for the clients to access, could make sense.\r\n\r\nCan discuss more later when I'm back, somewhere around 10:30 or

SSL-terminating reverse proxy in front of UFS which works with v4 sigs when that comes out.\r\n\r\nI think if we've decided that the best way to do this is to use Nginx in front of the console, I'd argue for using this same method in front of UFS too, instead of modifications to the java keystore. \r\n\r\nI think the Nginx using OpenSSL method is superior in many ways.\r\n* It can run directly on the CLC and/or on separate reverse proxy hardware in a DMZ for security-sensitive scenarios.\r\n* It handles SSL encryption logic in OpenSSL C code, better performance.\r\n* Nginx or Apache have long-term SNI support, allowing both console and UFS to run with SSL on the same single public IP.\r\n* Nginx is almost certainly been through, and continues to go through, more widespread and constant security audits, so making that the termination point for what may be Internet users is going to be more secure than having Internet users directly hit the CLC\r\n* Building on first point, having the ability to setup an SSL-terminating reverse proxy in a DMZ, separate from where Euca runs, means we can keep Euca behind additional \"interior\" corporate firewalls which usually exist between DMZ networks and internal networks. This is a requirement for PCI certification (no direct connections from the Internet to app servers).\r\n* Am I the only one that thinks we should be able to expose \"normal\" http and https URLs which run on the standard ports and therefore do not require ports in the URL? I just do not see URLs with ports visible in them in other software. This technique makes that possible.\r\n* It's possible to split out all UFS to separate hosts or combine them for larger configurations without having to worry about secondary IPs, as long as we use wildcard SSL certs, everything works with one public IP on each host.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael

show it here (see: [^_endpoints.json]), as I think that will make more clear what I mean as far as the benefits we get by moving Euca towards (at least) standardized (I'd make them mandatory) endpoints which:\r\n# Use the endpoint format: {noformat}{scheme}://{service}.{region}.{domain}{noformat}\r\n (i.e. [https://console.hp-aw2-1.hpcloudsvc.com], [https://cloudformation.hp-gol01-f1.mjc.prc.eucalyptus-systems.com])\r\n# Use the standard AWS service names, or at least give me a configuration parameter that lets me use [https://ec2.hp-aw2-1.hpcloudsvc.com] instead of or in addition to [https://console.hp-aw2-1.hpcloudsvc.com]\r\n# Includes the region code, which is a top-level cloud property, not something I can't change from \"eucalyptus\" at the top level (as returned by euca-describe-regions), but I can change with cloudformation.region lower down. If cloudformation and v2 signatures are going to require this, it seems like a fundamental property of the cloud which should be set, and it unchangeable, during initialization.\r\n# Has a parent domain, which ideally is consistent across all future federated clouds, so a single entry in the _endpoints.json file handles all of them.\r\n\r\nIf you look at that _endpoints.json file, you can see how they have this default logic at the top which handles all but exceptions, so if we used AWS service names, I would not have to define the exceptions you see for ec2, elasticloadbalancing, monitoring, swf, and some of sts further down. \r\n\r\nAnd, it should be clear that, just like I'm able to use one additional set of json snippets for both Discover systems (and more) as long as they all use hpcloudsvc.com as the parent domain, or another set to support all my PRC-based demo/test regions, trying to conform to AWS endpoint standard URLs means we can configure awscli or other botocore-based code with fewer additions.\r\n\r\nI just think the closer we hew, the fewer \"gotchas\" we're going to hit as we continue to chase what AWS is doing in the future.\r\n\r\nMore than anything - I just don't want to start setting up all these cool tweaks to get things like a reverse proxy or awscli to work, only to have 4.2+ break them - because you weren't aware of them. So, this is my attempt to \"sell\" you on the value of these...
