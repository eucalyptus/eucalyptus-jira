Based on this, didn't we decide we would deprioritize this to avoid adding more to the Services team's plate? Sorry if I'm missing anything here. \r\n\r\nIf my understanding isn't correct (I'd welcome it if that's the case :-), and we are able to report on the available capacity and usage within an account, then instances, block devices, S3 storage, elastic IPs would take precedence (in that order).

Used for capacity planning, etc.\r\n* this is about quotas being used for capacity planing purposes. \r\n* three things that limit: 1) physical stuff, 2) per-resource limits, 3) quotas (policy based, per-account or per-user). Account admin can't read policy applied to that account.\r\n* should we have default quotas applied to newly-created accounts? Not required for this feature. \r\n* shashi: show maximum permissible resource provisioning (quota-based) for your account and current usage. max could be by physical capacity or quotas. whatever we display should be correct. primary use case is to tell account admin when i need to ask for more of some thing. does not matter how these are computed. \r\n* chris: handle first use cases first. do things in sequence.\r\n* order of things we look at now: 1) limits, 2) capacity, 3) quotas. shashi: look for things that don't overlap? steve: limits and quotas generally don't overlap. limits are a user's view on what they can do. quota is defined in a policy and limit is defined some other way in implementation. limits are constraints, configuration options (like 10 resource tags).

objects across all buckets (capacity) (quota) (this may be removed in 4.0, please confirm with [~zhill]).\r\n* max permissible and current size of any individual object (service specific limit, not

Don't include them in scope of this feature.\r\n* object count (per bucket or total).\r\n\r\n[~zhill] and [~sjones] say that *none* of these parameters are currently available to the account admin without additional work. True for any resource. Anything that goes into IAM will have this restriction. \r\n\r\n[~sjones] says that we can get show capacity, tells you how many instances are available in the system (NOT ACCOUNT) and what is used. This is currently exposed to everyone, but is actually a bug. Same with describe AZ verbose. Should be configurable if you want to make this available to users or not, could be useful. \r\n\r\nlow-hanging fruit: get account summary shows you your quotas and usage for your IAM resources, but not your limits. Covers IAM. Have get account limits for AS. For EC2, describeAccountAttributes, shows very limited amount of info that we can see, but this is where we would add this. Would cover EBS as well. Nothing in S3 for this. [~zhill] says S3 is not quota friendly at all. Maybe bucket policies could do this, no reason mechanically we couldn't do that, but it's weird. \r\n\r\n[~shashi] agrees we should plan for this for 4.2 since it's fairly cross-cutting and requires some work on back end. Would need further planning and task breakdown to establish what all the cross-cutting tasks are etc. Change PRD-250 into a feature request for 4.2.
