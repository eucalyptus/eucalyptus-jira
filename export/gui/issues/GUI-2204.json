The reason is based on how we chose to implement each set of tabs.\r\nIn the case where we have multiple pages, 1 per tab (Instances, Scaling Groups, ELB, and Volumes detail pages), we have no memory of what state the help was in last time. If it is really important, we can save that in the session, or a cookie.\r\nIn the other screens, I made an attempt to match that behavior, with some obvious weirdness on the stack wizard. I missed the account detail page altogether, but that can be fixed.\r\n\r\nNow, I can make the single-page tabbed screens remember their help state if that makes sense. I wonder if a user opens help and find what they need, do they need it open after they've navigated away and back again?
