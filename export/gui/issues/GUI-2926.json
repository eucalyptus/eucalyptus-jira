In this case, there are parameters defined for KeyName and InstanceType similar to the following.\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n    \"KeyName\": {\r\n      \"Description\": \"Keypair to be used for SSH\",\r\n      \"Type\": \"AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName\",\r\n      \"Default\": \"KeyNameHere\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"InstanceType\": {\r\n      \"Description\": \"Instance Type\",\r\n      \"Type\": \"String\",\r\n      \"Default\": \"m1.large\"\r\n    },\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nEven with KeyNameHere as a valid key in my cloud and m1.large as a valid instance type, neither of these show up as the value in the Parameters list when creating a new stack in the console.  On the right side of the screen under Summary, it correctly identifies the KeyName and InstanceType values.  However, on the left side under the list of Parameters, it shows the KeyName value as a different keypair that I have created and the InstanceType is set to m1.small.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell based on dumping the data from testing the code, the defaults are being picked up correctly in the code and this makes sense due to the Summary entries on the right side of the screen showing the correct values as well.  So, I'm guessing that the code to make the selection of the default value in these dropdown lists after they are populated isn't working as expected.\r\n\r\nI'm also assuming that the expected behavior is for these lists to have the default value selected.  As a workaround for the customer, I have simply asked them to manually select the correct value from the list.  This also works fine from the command line which is another workaround option for them.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Stack Parameters aren't picking up the default value defined in the template","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=trevorw","name":"trevorw","key":"trevorw","accountId":"557058:09b6a9d7-07cc-4e99-a47e-c7916bf8fa67","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/481ed8973044192169acfec4aaf56a8f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/481ed8973044192169acfec4aaf56a8f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/481ed8973044192169acfec4aaf56a8f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/481ed8973044192169acfec4aaf56a8f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Trevor Williams","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=trevorw","name":"trevorw","key":"trevorw","accountId":"557058:09b6a9d7-07cc-4e99-a47e-c7916bf8fa67","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/481ed8973044192169acfec4aaf56a8f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/481ed8973044192169acfec4aaf56a8f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/481ed8973044192169acfec4aaf56a8f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/481ed8973044192169acfec4aaf56a8f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Trevor Williams","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_10000":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12100":"0|i044yn:","customfield_10001":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_11600":["mmunn1(mmunn1)","trevorw(trevorw)"],"customfield_10116":null,"customfield_10117":null,"environment":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/GUI-2926/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
