Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Just noticed an update to this this morning, and realized I did not respond to David's last question.\r\n\r\nThat's a very good question, actually. I'm not sure if ec2-user is something we'd likely see for ported images. I have tended to create a \"centos\" or \"rhel\" user similar to what ubuntu does when I roll my own images, but that's not something likely useful to your more generic use case. I don't know if there's an easy way to auto-discover this information.\r\n\r\nI did see just yesterday a \"trick\", which was not really a trick, for finding out what the default user is - basically you ssh in as root with the appropriate ssh key, and get the message ' Please login as the user \"ec2-user\" rather than the user \"root\" ' message. This is based on the common practice of installing the key pair specified on the run-instances request in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys with this prefix:\r\n\r\nno-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,command=\"echo 'Please login as the user \\\"ec2-user\\\" rather than the user \\\"root\\\".';echo;sleep 10\" ssh-rss <key here>\r\n\r\nA slick way to deal with this might be to add a \"default user\" column to any table we use for meta-data about images, and add some logic to the image registration commands that looks inside the raw image to extract the cloud-init configuration related to the default user.\r\n\r\nBased on my reading, I think this line is added to root's authorized keys when the line \"disable_root: true\" or \"disable_root: 1\" is added to /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg. For the alternate user, this defaults to \"ec2-user\", unless the line \"user: ubuntu\" or \"user: centos\" or similar is also in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.\r\n\r\nSo, on any attempt to register a new image, I'd loopback mount the raw image, chroot inside, parse /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg looking for those two lines, and then set a new \"default user\" meta-data field on the image to root if \"disable_root\" is not set, or either ec2-user or the value of the \"user\" line if root is disabled.  Then you could extract that value when creating any login commands. Not sure how hard this would be, but it certainly would be user-friendly to those using the command you display.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-09-14T11:24:48.682-0500","updated":"2015-09-14T11:24:48.682-0500"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/GUI-1703/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
