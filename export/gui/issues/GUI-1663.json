This will help developers perform pre-flight checks before opening a PR, and will provide reviewers a consistent set of criteria when examining code in a PR.\r\n\r\nFirst things first:\r\n- Features and bug fixes *must* be tested across Eucalyptus and AWS (unless the feature is Euca-only).\r\n- Features and bug fixes *should* be tested in the major browsers we support (IE 10+ and latest Chrome, Firefox and Safari), and the browsers/devices tested on *should* be listed in the PR's description or the Jira ticket.\r\n- Features and bug fixes *should* pass UX review prior to code review, unless an implementation code review is requested prior to UX review.\r\n  \r\n- Features in a PR *should* be only relevant to a single ticket.  In a few cases, multiple related tickets *may* be combined in a single PR where appropriate (e.g. if a single fix spans multiple tickets), but unrelated tickets *must not* be combined.\r\n\r\nCriteria for all code:\r\n- Code *should* use an indentation level of 4 spaces (not tabs!).\r\n\r\nCriteria for Python:\r\n- Python modules *must* be PEP8-compliant (with line breaks at 120 char instead of 80).\r\n- Strings that are displayed in the interface *must* be marked for i18n.\r\n- Unused variables and imports *must* be removed.\r\n- Stray comments and print statements *must* be removed.\r\n- Unit tests *must* be provided for new features and *should* be provided for bug fixes.\r\n- Python-based Selenium tests *should* be provided after GUI-1612 is implemented.\r\n\r\nCriteria for HTML:\r\n- HTML *must* be XHTML-compliant to avoid breaking i18n and potentially causing unexpected rendering problems in the browser.\r\n- Each id attribute for a given HTML page *must* be unique, meaning a page *must not* contain two or more elements with the same id attribute.\r\n- HTML tags that wrap words *must* be marked for translation via the i18n:translate attribute, and the tag that contains the i18n:attribute *must not* have child tags.\r\n- HTML code indentation level *should* be 4 spaces when possible.  If a file has many levels of nesting, 2 spaces *may* be used for indentation, as long as the entire file is consistent.\r\n- Inline JS (within script tags and in HTML attributes) *must* be avoided.\r\n- References to JS files in script tags *must* use the minified version of the file when available.\r\n\r\nCriteria for JS:\r\n- All JS code *must* pass the JSHint lint checker.\r\n- JS code *should* adhere to the Google JS Style Guide (but with indentation set to 4 spaces as mentioned above) - https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml\r\n- JS code *should* have Jasmine-based tests when possible.\r\n- AngularJS code *should* follow the style guide at https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide (eases transition to Angular 2)\r\n\r\nCriteria for SCSS/CSS:\r\n- Selectors *should* use classes rather than ids when possible for reuse.\r\n- SCSS files *should* avoid more than two levels of nesting.\r\n- Inline styles (within style tags and in HTML attributes) *must* be avoided.\r\n- Existing styles *should* be reused or extended rather than creating new styles.\r\n\r\nSecurity Criteria:\r\n- All user-generated input that is displayed on the page *must* be invulnerable to Angular expression injections and should be escaped by one of three ways:  Passing the input to the template as a string (for read-only display), escaping server-side via BaseView.escape_braces(), or escaping client-side via an ng-non-bindable attribute.\r\n\r\nGitHub PR Formatting and Jira Workflow:\r\n- The GitHub pull request *must* contain a descriptive title prefixed with the Jira ticket(s), and the description *must* contain a link to the Jira ticket.  See https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucaconsole/pull/1337 for an example.\r\n- The Jira ticket *must* include a link to the pull request, and the ticket *should* be assigned to the reviewer via the \"Submit Patch\" operation.\r\n\r\nEssential Resources:\r\n- HTML: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML\r\n- CSS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS\r\n- JS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript\r\n- Testing on IE: https://www.modern.ie/en-us\r\n- Web standards implementation:
