So much action lately, this one slipped through. Thanks for all the hard work!\r\n\r\n> * tab selections shouldn't be in the breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs should stop with the scaling group.\r\nHmm, this isn't ideal, now that we've axed the title bars.  How do we communicate what page they're on if the breadcrumb hierarchy is truncated?\r\nIs this still a question after our phone conversation yesterday, or are we good on this one? I think we are? (Decision: Breadcrumbs do not include tab selections)  \r\n\r\n> * second section on general tab looks weird without a subsection header. Can you add one, please? \"Details\"?\r\nYep, will do\r\nThanks! \r\n\r\n> * If we are keeping termination policies, can you put a little help icon next to those that says to add them in the oder they should be executed, please? BONUS TO HAVE THAT, thanks!!!\r\nWill do\r\nTHANK YOU! \r\n\r\n> I think they should also go with the capacity stuff, since they dictate how instances are killed when the group gets scaled down?\r\nWill do\r\nGracias.\r\n\r\n> * create alarm dialog should use progressive display to only show fields when choices have been made previously that affect them (see the mad lib email I sent you for where the hidden stuff should break, ping me if you need me on this)\r\nWe're auto-populating sane defaults to pre-select the most sensible choices in the context of a scaling group.  We can do something similar in the context of an instance, for example, when we enable CloudWatch alarms for instances.\r\nI think we are also OK here based on our phone convo, yes? (DECISION: mad lib as is is good, but units need to not be a dropdown and should just be text that updates based on the selected metric, since there's only one sane value for each one anyway.) \r\n\r\n> * create alarm must allow for custom metric creation (see mad lib email for how to include this)\r\nWe're hard-coding the list of metric types (like we did in 3.4), so we won't actually pull any custom metrics anyway.\r\nCould we shelve this for post 4.0 since it's a fairly significant effort?\r\nI will talk to [~shashi] to confirm this one and get back to you ASAP after I hear from him.  \r\n\r\n> * instance tab, can get rid of \"View properties\" in action menu, since the instance ID is a link anyway.\r\nHmm, that would be inconsistent with the instances landing page.  Are you sure?\r\nWell, let's leave it for now. I am concerned that it will take users very far from where they mean to be if they click it, and they'll have to navigate all the way back to the scaling group's details if they want to do anything. But we can take a wait and see approach on this until I do user testing.  \r\n\r\n> * instance tab: terminate should be available in actions menus\r\nProviding a terminate instance option here is fairly involved and will likely involve code duplication.  Marking an instance unhealthy eventually terminates it.  Are we sure linking to the instance and terminating it from the instance detail page isn't good enough (at least for now)?\r\nYeah, this one I'd really prefer to have here please. I know that marking it unhealthy will eventually terminate it, but for user's sake let's be direct. It's just a modal box, after all, can't be that bad? \r\n\r\n> * default cooling period should be on the policies tab, not general\r\nIt was much easier to combine the cooling period with the rest of the properties, allowing us to use a single, unified API call to update a scaling group.  We can look into moving it to the policies tab, but there doesn't seem to be a good place to put it there (and it would seem \"orphaned\" there).  I'd be happy to move it there if you strongly feel it should go there however.\r\nI feel more strongly about the ability to terminate the instances, so why don't you do that one and I'll live with this one like it is. Sound good?\r\n\r\nThank you!!!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jloza","name":"jloza","key":"jloza","accountId":"557058:a300fccb-c87c-4e2e-88b5-de2013c0846e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jenny Loza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-01-24T10:55:59.519-0600","updated":"2014-01-24T10:55:59.519-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/24979/comment/61943","id":"61943","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jloza","name":"jloza","key":"jloza","accountId":"557058:a300fccb-c87c-4e2e-88b5-de2013c0846e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jenny Loza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"[~kgill], based on our phone conversation today, if there are no scaling policies associated with a scaling group, there should be inline text at the top of the general (and instances too if it's not too much trouble) tabs that says \"To automatically scale your group up or down, please [add scaling policies].
