recently upgraded to Eucaconsole 4.3 and several users have complained that the running instances are now shown as gray (among other very many bad color changes). This is inconsistent with most management tools which show green for running and red for stopped, similar to a traffic light invented many years ago. Not the mention the HPE green is terrible for reading text, but I won't digress here.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding this decision was probably made by HPE management who will never use this tool a day in their life, I place no blame on any developer. My suggestion would be for making this color a variable to please both management and end users who actually use this product, and to give the end user some choice. Not to mention the confusion it causes branding an open source product the same as the paid-for product, but I won't digress there either.\r\n\r\nI started doing research on CSS variables, and it not an easy task, but hopefully someone at Eucalyptus or the community could chip and and make it happen.

I suspect this will change again in the 2nd quarter. If you'd like to play with these colors, I recommend getting the source, installing \"compass\" per our README file and making changes in the SASS files. You'd be able to generate new CSS which can be installed on top of a package install to affect the styles of everything.\r\nI hear what you're asking for and we've played with configurability for some major branding colors, but not for the status backgrounds.

On of my engineers was a web developer for 3 years and has a lot of CSS experience. What would be the best way for us to contribute back these changes?\r\n\r\nA lot of the color variables are either a) no longer used or b) reference a color in the name of the variable (bad practice) rather than function type. One improvement we would like to contribute is getting it such that the variables are nested in that you could change only a handful of colors as sort of a \"theme\", and then have those colors reference parts of the page as variables (i.e. navigation bar, primary link color, background color, etc.)\r\n\r\nI attached an example of one such improvement made to the left navigation pane where we removed the {{overflow-y}} scroll bar and also added a lightgray background to the lables to clearly separate the different sections.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jgallucci32","name":"jgallucci32","key":"jgallucci32","accountId":"557058:1cd98ee4-b2ee-4683-a315-2a6abd75b048","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"John Gallucci","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-01-16T14:02:59.298-0600","updated":"2017-01-16T14:02:59.298-0600"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/53203/comment/120822","id":"120822","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Running instances will be displayed as green (and stopped instances as red) in the upcoming 4.4.1 version of the Eucalyptus Management Console.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-04-14T13:50:46.576-0500","updated":"2017-04-14T13:53:21.222-0500"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/GUI-2859/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_11808":null}}
