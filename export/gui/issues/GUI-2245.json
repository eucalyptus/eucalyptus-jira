We’ve certainly had the problem of having a scalable way to deliver e-mails as part of the product, so it’s always fallen by the way-side.\r\nAccounts (and probably users) can have attributes (in eucalyptus), with e-mail being one of those. I wonder if we could offer another way to authenticate users.\r\nBrowsers have a hard time with remembering acct/user/password We’ve had to add additional stuff to remember the account name. Going to a simple user/password login would be a better UX, IMHO. If we could start using e-mail address tied to an acct/user, so that we require e-mail/password to login (which is just like aws accounts), I think we could make this work.\r\nWe’d likely have to configure one way or another (console.ini). Our customers would need to operate one way or another. Since our STS auth call is custom for euca, we are free to change that in a way that we feel would help our users.\"\r\n[~sjones], maybe you could help w/ some of the details like \"can we store an e-mail address attribute for each user?\", \"Would it be possible to support login w/ e-mail/password?\" and \"Are there any plans to offer e-mail-as-a-service, which the console may leverage if we
