A couple of comments:\r\n\r\n* Spacing between labels and widgets seems...wide. Should be tightened up, please. You can look at instance details for a guideline to spacing\r\n* Also, it seems like there's a TON of spacing between the edge of the container and the labels, button, etc. Please tighten that up, it will also help the labels to not wrap.\r\n* The disabled widget doesn't really look disabled. Also, it gets a key line (in chrome) when I hover over it. Is that actually disabled?\r\n* If I go back and deselect a scaling group, the policy is still selected, and the button doesn't disable. Clicking the button actually adds the action with no scaling group, which is invalid\r\n* Cancel link is missing\r\n* When I try to save changes without adding an action that i have defined, I should get a dialog notifying me (see tag editor for example. It just went ahead and did something, but then i got a 404. Note that I get the 404 even without malformed actions, or any actions at all.\r\n* I shouldn't be able to select the same policy twice. If it's already there, we should not include it in the list.
