expected behavior is the image is readily available in the Management Console. Why would the Eucaconsole expect different?\r\n* Suggesting a user problem be fixed by an admin is not a viable workaround.  By the time a user creates an image via CLI, sees it is not there, emails his/her local admin, and the admin restarts the service, more than likely the time has elapsed for it to appear automatically making the whole process a waste of everyone's time.\r\n\r\nThis is low priority for us since our build server creates images at night, but it sure is a pain to troubleshoot the build process during the day (usually I just manually enter the image id in the URL to see the image).\r\n\r\nWould be nice to hot have to wait until 5.0.0 to have this basic functionality restored.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jgallucci32","name":"jgallucci32","key":"jgallucci32","accountId":"557058:1cd98ee4-b2ee-4683-a315-2a6abd75b048","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FavatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/31cfdf964a6ac26962c22f3279e2c85c?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26avatarId%3D10122%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"John Gallucci","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-08-26T22:59:16.642-0500","updated":"2016-08-26T22:59:51.299-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/44801/comment/109562","id":"109562","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"[~jgallucci32], It can take up to 30 seconds to load a whole list of public images from an AWS region.
