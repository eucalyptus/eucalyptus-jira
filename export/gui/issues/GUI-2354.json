A couple of notes:\r\n\r\n* The threshold should not be where the chart tops out, there needs to be room always above the threshold for the metric value to be visible when it exceeds the threshold. To do this, for metrics where the range is known (for example, percentages will always top out at 100%) make the top value of the Y axis the top value in the range + 25% (rounding up to a logical thing like the next whole number, so, in the percentage example, the y axis top value would be 125). For metrics where there is no known top boundary make the top of the chart the alarm threshold +25% (rounding up to a logical thing like the next whole number, for example, if the metric value is count and the alarm threshold is 3 then the y axis would end at 4 (or maybe 5, I am terrible at math)\r\n* for accessibility, the threshold line should be easily visually differentiated from the dimension's line in the chart without using only color, that is why the wireframe shows a dotted line. Would be great if you could do a dotted red line, please. \r\n* Also, there's no need to include the threshold in the legend (in either of the places the legend shows), please hide that. \r\n\r\nAgain, awesome start! Can't wait to see the next iteration.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jloza","name":"jloza","key":"jloza","accountId":"557058:a300fccb-c87c-4e2e-88b5-de2013c0846e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jenny Loza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-05-04T16:37:42.170-0500","updated":"2016-05-04T16:37:42.170-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/40113/comment/102361","id":"102361","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~jloza]: Thanks for the feedback.
