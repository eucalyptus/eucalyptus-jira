The goal was to replace the beaker.cache implementation with dogpile.cache and use mecached as the back end. For reasons to not simply use beaker with mecached, read this: http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2012/04/19/using-beaker-for-caching-why-you-ll-want-to-switch-to-dogpile.cache/\r\n\r\nI've installed these 2 additional packages;\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/dogpile.cache/0.5.3\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-memcached/1.53\r\nin addition, I installed memcached on on my laptop (and run that in a separate shell using 'memcached -vv')\r\n\r\nThe usage of dogpile.cache is a little different, but essentially the same. You still define a \"creation\" method that fetches the data you wish to cache. You use a decorator to specify that the results get cached. Cache keys are generated automatically based on those function arguments, so you can pass values that aren't needed by the method, simply to include them in the cache key.\r\nI ran into trouble with not being able to get the value saved in the cache. I've been connecting to memcached via telnet \"telnet localhost 11211\" and can issue commands like \"stats\", \"stats items\", etc. That can show what's happening with the cache more directly. Also using \"-vvv\" when starting memcached provides even more verbose output for debugging.\\\r\n\r\nSo, back to the values not saving.. Spent time in pdb and there isn't anything preventing the value being saved from what I can tell. Though after giving up last night, I thought we might be facing a problem with pickling the boto objects. pickling is the encoding scheme used to send objects to the cache over the wire. We've had problems pickling or json-encoding boto objects in the past and I wrote a special encoder to convert them to json for the 3.x console. I think this is where the problem lays. I even found someone online who said \"I always convert my objects to dictionaries or json before caching\".\r\n\r\nIn reading, I also found some useful insights from dogpile.cache's author Mike Bayer.\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/dogpile.cache/issue/17/is-there-any-way-to-force-a-refresh\r\nOne thing that stood out for our consideration was;\r\n\r\n\"the region is meant to be kind of a homebase for a certain set of config, so it wasn't intended to be per-key or anything like that\"\r\n\r\nThis means we could (should) define a single cache region based on expiration. Expiration can be overridden later, but it is more convenient to configure when setting up the region. Another thing I noticed is that you can define a namespace for each thing  you cache. That means that for (say) images, you could define an images namespace. That gets included in the cache key prior to the argument list passed to the function. In that way, we could separate the different resource caches within the region. An example is:\r\n    @cache_region.cache_on_arguments(namespace=\"images\")\r\n    def _get_images_cached_(self, _owners, _executors, _ec2_region, acct):\r\n\r\nNotice that self is there, which doesn't get included in the cache key. Also notice \"acct\" which is used purely to cache based on account. I can pass \"\" for acct to have a shared value across accounts (like for 'amazon' and 'aws_marketplace' images)\r\n\r\nI think that's it for now. I will play with making the image list serializable before caching to see if that helps. Beyond that, there is more work to more properly configure the regions we need and handle installing memcached as a dependency. Invalidation is a little different here as well (as the discussion in that last link talks about). Once I can get a value saved and retrieved from the cache, I think this will work out fine.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-05-14T10:17:40.545-0500","updated":"2014-05-14T10:17:40.545-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/29375/comment/70093","id":"70093","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"I've been able to get the images list to save in the cache (and pull from the cache).

The size of the first two in aws us-west-1 is (215759+682165=897924). That is slightly different for each region, but those numbers are some of the higher ones. So, multiply 900K * 7 regions and get 6.3MB. Since that's an order of magnitude below the default memory limit, I think we're fine with that for the near future.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I tested memcached configured with 1MB. I found that when the cache fills up, older values are kicked out to keep below the limit. I tested this by telnet-ing into memcached and running \"stats\" to show memory usage. Here's an example of 2 values I was looking at:\r\nSTAT bytes_written 911487\r\nSTAT limit_maxbytes 1048576\r\nThe bytes_written value would change, but remain in that general range as I added more values. I would do this by switching to an AWS region I haven't viewed before and looking a different image sets. I could then create a keypair and the file was available for download, which means that won't break when the cache is \"full\". This also means the cache has a pretty decent full fall-back behavior in that it handles it gracefully.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-07-01T15:33:59.722-0500","updated":"2014-07-02T10:24:24.978-0500"},{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/29375/comment/73176","id":"73176","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Submitted an issue to dogpile.cache about detecting memcached set failure: https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/dogpile.cache/issue/64/unable-to-detect-when-memcached-isnt\r\n\r\nI coded a patch to dogpile.cache to help with memcached failures.
