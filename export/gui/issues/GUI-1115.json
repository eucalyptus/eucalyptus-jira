I assume we'd either have encryption keys in code or config, so that means they are plain text for someone with access to the machine hosting the console to view. I assume the same would be true for any SASL password? This also means the SASL user must be configured for memcached to allow us to authenticate the connection. We also must use a client library that supports this (libmemcached and pylibmc do support it in older versions we can use), and you mentioned that memcached would need to be re-compiled for SASL as well. The biggest hurdle here is re-building memcached since we'd need to package it ourselves.\r\nJust did more digging and it looks like the 3rd memcached client we haven't tried yet does support SASL.
