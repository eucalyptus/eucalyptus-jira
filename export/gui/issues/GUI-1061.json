I can also allow or deny specific operations by opening up the service's section and selecting something next to those operations.  (See the attached screenshot.)\r\n\r\nWhen I use both whole-service and operation-specific selectors at the same time, the way the two are nested makes the latter look like exceptions to the former.  For instance, if I click the check mark next to \"All EC2 actions\" and the X next to \"AllocateAddress\" like the screenshot shows, it looks like I am going to get a policy that allows everything except for AllocateAddress.  What I actually end up with is a policy that allows everything and then denies AllocateAddress.  This is not an issue for users with only one policy, but since deny statements always override allow statements, if one of my users belongs to another group that _does_ allow her to use AllocateAddress this policy will break that.\r\n\r\nThe AWS policy generator addresses this by making \"All actions\" and individual selection mutually exclusive.  Another potential way of addressing it is by making changing the state of an \"All actions\" row also change the state of everything below it.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/attachment/20225","id":"20225","filename":"policygen-nesting.png","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett

The admin can still add only the op-specific things they want by just clicking them. \r\n\r\nWe may need to make some UX improvements in the editor in our next iteration; that is to be expected.
