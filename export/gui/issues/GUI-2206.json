After some discussion with the team we chose to favor AngularJS form validation above others as it provides greater flexibility above Foundation:Abide and native HTML5.\r\n\r\nI addressed GUI-2168 as a discrete but non-trivial example of form validation.  The user editor portion of the account creation form and the user creation form were both affected.  The PR that addresses this ticket demonstrates a few key features that make using AngularJS form validation preferable:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/eucalyptus/eucaconsole/pull/1678/files#diff-673cc6d7d138aefb669356eb65e12061L4\r\n\r\n# Works with existing HTML5 attributes, such as required and pattern.  AngularJS provides directives to handle these cases.\r\n# Further field validation may be provided using custom directives.  In the PR for GUI-2168 a directive to enforce reserved words is added.\r\n# Built-in and custom validators work consistently in AngularJS.  No necessary special cases.\r\n# Validation is exposed on the native HTML form as classes which may be used to show/hide error messages, including messaging specific to the different types of validation present.  This can be used to provide more precise messaging to the user.\r\n# Validation is also exposed in the AngularJS API and may be used to trigger further custom behavior.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation made by the team going forward is to focus on AngularJS for validation of new forms and when adding new features.  While it is not recommended that we spend time going back thru all existing forms to update them to AngularJS validation, we should consider updating forms that are touched while adding new features as is practical.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ashamblin","name":"ashamblin","key":"ashamblin","accountId":"557058:61bef8bf-3b54-4a71-b11a-63b62b777e51","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/62bdd45d81181d05144e30e5c6215f5d?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dashamblin%26avatarId%3D16500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/62bdd45d81181d05144e30e5c6215f5d?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dashamblin%26avatarId%3D16500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/62bdd45d81181d05144e30e5c6215f5d?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dashamblin%26avatarId%3D16500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/62bdd45d81181d05144e30e5c6215f5d?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dashamblin%26avatarId%3D16500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Adam Shamblin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2015-11-09T16:37:10.105-0600","updated":"2015-11-09T16:37:10.105-0600"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
