Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"It is set to true.\r\n\r\nThe problem only happens in Chrome. I decided to look for the error message: \"chrome Further, this page includes other resources which are not secure\". First link was:\r\n\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3292697/find-out-what-resources-are-not-going-over-https\r\n\r\nHighest response seemed to indicate Chrome does this occasionally and restarting fixes it:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    Solution: close Chrome and re-open.\r\n\r\n    Chrome must cache its secure-content detection so ... \r\n\r\nBased on that advice, I closed Chrome and re-opened it and the problem was no longer there. \r\n\r\nHere's what I think may have happened - I had just re-installed the cloud in question, and confirmed the console was working properly with the self-signed certificate, before installing my own trusted root and wildcard SSL cert, then restarting eucaconsole and embedded Nginx and testing again that it worked.\r\n\r\nI can't remember if that error was there or not at that point, as I immediately then replace the default Nginx install with my external Nginx proxy variant which handles both the console and API endpoints via a two-server (site) proxy which depends on SNI to serve both via the same public IP instead, as I think I've mentioned to you a few times. It was only on this one that I noticed this error.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that the initial load of the page must have included some embedded javascript library or graphic which was associated with the self-signed cert at the embedded download url, and this was cached. So when a later load of the same page, now protected by my new internal trusted root CA signed wildcard cert, was loaded, it attempted to use one or more of these cached items, and Chrome (only Chrome it seems, since this happens no where else) must be tracking what cert signed all cached content, and flagging as a security issue when all content on a page is not signed by the same cert.\r\n\r\nCurious if you agree? In any event, I think this is not a bug, and you can close this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=mcrawford","name":"mcrawford","key":"mcrawford","accountId":"557058:75e0a4e1-089b-40d0-a2fa-f65a508a115e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3737aee022e72f1e8f391d899fb15e1e?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dmcrawford%26avatarId%3D15800%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Michael Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-01-08T21:19:39.812-0600","updated":"2016-01-08T21:19:39.812-0600"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/GUI-2370/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"customfield_11808":null,"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]}}}
