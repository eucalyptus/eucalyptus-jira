icons on landing pages have an unwanted border and drop-down caret\r\n- Top nav line separators are no longer extra light grey\r\n- User detail page white background no longer wraps main content (for all tabs)\r\n- Spacing below labels on landing page filters is too small\r\n- Min/desired/max form labels are behind the inputs on the scaling group detail page and create scaling group wizard\r\n- Many links are blue instead of green (e.g. tile links on dashboard and sort links on landing pages)\r\n- The \"Add a policy\" tile on the scaling group policy page isn't centered and is blue\r\n- The \"Attach a volume\" tile on the instance volumes page isn't centered and is blue\r\n- The \"Create a snapshot\" tile on the volume snapshots page isn't centered and is blue\r\n- Tile headers are missing a background color on landing pages (tile view) and select detail pages\r\n- Off-canvas top nav menu no longer displays when nav collapses\r\n- There is too much spacing below the labels in the summary section of the wizards\r\n- There is too little spacing below the form labels on the login and change password pages\r\n- There is too little padding around the form on the login page\r\n- The select buttons in the image picker in the launch instance and launch config wizards have an unwanted border, color, and text wrapping\r\n\r\nAnd there may be many more issues that need to be fixed.
