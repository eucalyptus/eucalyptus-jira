On the other hand, on Eucalyptus, it still launches instances using all the security groups -- it's not clear on the impact of such security groups on the instance.\r\n\r\nOn a separate issue, when creating a scaling group, it also ignores that the selected launch config belongs to a specific VPC, thus the console allows user to potentially mismatch the VPC of the LC and selected VPC for SG.

the next step as long as they have security groups in different VPC networks. Jenny will provide an error message to display in a modal box for this. Also if we change security groups in the launch config detail page. \r\n2) when creating scaling groups, only display and allow VPC networks that match those in the selected launch config. \r\n3) when changing the launch config for an existing scaling group, only allow LC with security groups that match the VPC network of the scaling group. \r\n\r\nToo broad of a fix to apply in 4.1, should push.
