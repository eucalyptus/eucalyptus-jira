Web application by their nature should have SSL enabled by default to prevent disclosure of credentials and other sensitive information which is inevitable exchanged over the wire.\r\n- The console does not have robust support for tuning processing of HTTP requests. For example, the console has to rely on nginx to limit the size of a file upload. Having more control over HTTP requests and imposing limits is an important security control.\r\n\r\nThis feature is about investigating alternatives and determining a deployment model for the console that addresses the above concerns. If nginx continues to be an integral part of a sane deployment, it needs to be integrated into the install procedure as much as possible to ensure that users get secure deployments out of the box or with very few changes on their own.\r\n\r\nUPDATE (2/3/15):\r\nWe've settled on requiring nginx to run the console, with nginx in front of the Pyramid app served by gunicorn (WSGI server). Note that all connections to the console will be on port 80 and 443. We will modify the console.ini file to bind to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) rather than 0.0.0.0 to prevent the WSGI server (defaults to port 8888) from being accessed directly.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":"GUI-1553","customfield_11500":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":0,"attachment":[],"summary":"Provide an HTTPS-by-default installation of the Console","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[{"id":"34379","key":"GUI-1574","self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/34379","fields":{"summary":"Investigate/Propose options to enable HTTPS support for console","status":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.
