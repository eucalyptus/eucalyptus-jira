Consider that a new ECC user tends to launch one of the images they see within the first page of the Images list. Additionally:\r\n  * Many images were uploaded by ECC users\r\n  * Many of _those_ images are not functional\r\n  * The sort order of the Images list does not present \"Eucalyptus validated\" images at the top\r\n\r\nIt was suggested that tagging images will improve the situation. What isn't clear about that proposal is whether those tags will be used by the User Console to pre-filter the Images list, or how the end user would know which tags to search for. Remember that we have to assume the user will not have read any documentation and would therefore have no idea about those tags.\r\n\r\nUse case:\r\nA new cloud user wants to evaluate Eucalyptus as a potential cloud platform for development. Like many cloud users she tends to use instances (EC2) and storage (S3) services. She has some experience with AWS and wants to see how similar Eucalyptus is to AWS. She signs up for the ECC, receives her account login details and logs into the ECC. Now she attempts to launch an instance. She picks an image that appears on the first page, takes defaults where possible and selects values for those that are defaulted. She launches the image, waits until the image is running and logs into the instance. Later she shuts down the instance, logs out of ECC.\r\n\r\nThe Use Case above has a high potential for failure within the ECC deployment because the first page of the images list are mainly garage images.\r\n\r\nThe ideal scenario would guide the user to a set of \"validated\" or \"approved\" images. For instance, when the user takes the initial action to launch an instance, the User Console could default to showing only validated images. The user would have to take a specific action to increase the scope of images listed. In this way the default path through the product would result in success - or at least at a much higher rate than present.
