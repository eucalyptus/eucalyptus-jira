It makes possible things which are not possible otherwise:\r\n- horizontal scalability\r\n- isolated network environment w/ system enforced network restrictions\r\n- self-configuration when the system changes (because of UFS)\r\n- domain naming support for a fixed console endpoint (e.g., console.eucalyptus.subdomain.com)\r\n- load balancing requests w/ ELB\r\n- auto scaling based on console controlled triggers \r\n- possibility of non-trivial topologies for the console (e.g., w/ a shared service of some kind)\r\n\r\nList of stuff that can/should be done to support this...\r\n- Make the

Define health check to use HTTPS/443 and path of \"/\". Select the zone or zones you wish to use for your scaling group(s).\r\n# create an SSL cert using the ELB public DNS name, or configure a DNS record pointing to the ELB and use that DNS name in your SSL cert.\r\n# Add a listener to the ELB for HTTP/443 on the client and instance side, using the SSL cert you just created.\r\n# create security group for scaling group (console servers). Open port port 443 to incoming traffic from the security group being used by the ELB.\r\n# create launch config using attached cloud-init script in user-data. Use a CentOS 6 image. We can use m1.medium, but our min server spec states 4 cores and 8GB of memory, so m3.2xlarge w/ 4 cores and 4G memory is closest to that. Be sure to modify the 10th line in the cloud-init script to use the cloud back-end FQDN in place of the name already there. Near the bottom of the cloud-init script are 2 random keys. You should generate your own to ensure some uniqueness in your session cookie encryption. On CentOS, run \"cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1\" to create a new random 32 character string.\r\n# create an autoscaling group that uses this launch configuration and the ELB. You might want to set a propagating tag to label instances in this autoscaling group. If you want to manually scale this group, you can start with min/desired/max set to 1, but adjust desired/max to reflect the number of instances you'd like. A better way is to set up scaling policies, one to scale up, another to scale down based on CPU load. Sustained CPU load over 90% is usually a good sign you want to add another instance. Sustained CPU load under 40% likely means you can remove an instance.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you will see 1 instance being launched and in a couple of minutes, it will show healthy and \"in-service\" in the ELB, at which point, you can start using the console.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=ccassler","name":"ccassler","key":"ccassler","accountId":"557058:8fb32702-a3cf-42d3-9846-95c74f801354","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ace94e80ebc0a3b718cc5422760b57de?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dccassler%26avatarId%3D14700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ace94e80ebc0a3b718cc5422760b57de?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dccassler%26avatarId%3D14700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ace94e80ebc0a3b718cc5422760b57de?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dccassler%26avatarId%3D14700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/ace94e80ebc0a3b718cc5422760b57de?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dccassler%26avatarId%3D14700%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Casey

Define health check to use HTTPS/443 and path of \"/\". Select the zone or zones you wish to use for your scaling group(s).\r\n # create an SSL cert using the ELB public DNS name, or configure a DNS record pointing to the ELB and use that DNS name in your SSL cert. (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ssl-server-cert.html#create-cert)\r\n # Add a listener to the ELB for HTTP/443 on the client and instance side, using the SSL cert you just created.\r\n # create security group for scaling group (console servers) which you will use in your launch configuration. Open port ports 80 and 443 to incoming traffic from the security group being used by the ELB.\r\n # create launch config using attached cloud-init script in user-data. Use a CentOS 6 image. We can use m1.medium, but our min server spec states 4 cores and 8GB of memory, so m3.2xlarge w/ 4 cores and 4G memory is closest to that. Be sure to modify the 10th line in the cloud-init script to use the cloud back-end FQDN in place of the name already there. Near the bottom of the cloud-init script are 2 random keys. You should generate your own to ensure some uniqueness in your session cookie encryption. On CentOS, run \"cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1\" to create a new random 32 character string.\r\n # create an autoscaling group that uses this launch configuration and the ELB. You might want to set a propagating tag to label instances in this autoscaling group. If you want to manually scale this group, you can start with min/desired/max set to 1, but adjust desired/max to reflect the number of instances you'd like. A better way is to set up scaling policies, one to scale up, another to scale down based on CPU load. Sustained CPU load over 90% is usually a good sign you want to add another instance. Sustained CPU load under 40% likely means you can remove an instance.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you will see 1 instance being launched and in a couple of minutes, it will show healthy and \"in-service\" in the ELB, at which point, you can start using the console.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David
