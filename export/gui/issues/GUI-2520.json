This EC2 feature allows one to see the status of a few basic checks of both the hosts that instances run on as well as the instances' reachability.  These status checks are the basis of the {{StatusCheckFailed}}, {{StatusCheckFailed_Instance}}, and {{StatusCheckFailed_System}} CloudWatch metrics.  Note that this feature is separate from both auto-scaling status checks and load balancer status checks.\r\n\r\nInstance status information also includes any scheduled events that may affect the state of an instance, such as when AWS must reboot or retire a host.\r\n\r\nThe AWS console includes status information in four locations:  the table on the Instances page, which shows a summary of instances' status checks; a splash on the instance detail pane with information about upcoming events; a \"Status Checks\" tab on the instance detail pane; and a dedicated Events page.  Screenshots of those are attached.\r\n\r\nThe euca2ools implementation of this feature is euca-describe-instance-status.\r\n\r\nI happen to have an EC2 instance with both a scheduled event and several non-healthy status checks that I am happy to volunteer for the purposes of testing this feature.  However, that instance will die on the 20th of April.  If this feature is ready for testing before then then please let me know so I can grant the appropriate access for it.","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"summary":"Instance status checks and events","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=gholms","name":"gholms","key":"gholms","accountId":"557058:6e5fdc25-c797-4d3d-8fd4-55c3c4ed99b0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/3e16def22dd4a96dbe507df70f15f37f?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dgholms%26avatarId%3D18100%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Garrett Holmstrom","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_10000":null,"customfield_12100":"0|i03p47:","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":"2016-04-07T10:15:47.232-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10004":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_11600":["gholms(gholms)","jloza(jloza)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"customfield_11805":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11806":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/GUI-2520/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/42107/comment/101139","id":"101139","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=jloza","name":"jloza","key":"jloza","accountId":"557058:a300fccb-c87c-4e2e-88b5-de2013c0846e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/7eaf2606f1573e09573245ae213c6212?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Djloza%26avatarId%3D17500%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Jenny Loza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"hi [~gholms], why would we need an EC2 instance to check this?
