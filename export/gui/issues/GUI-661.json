I'm pasting it all here for full context:\r\n\r\nI've done this and I'm looking at code that takes a different approach, so I want to have a discussion about pros and cons.\r\n\r\nI'm seeing this in a tal:define:\r\n             action landingpage_action if landingpage else detailpage_action;\r\nand this in the template markup:\r\n            <p i18n:translate=\"\" tal:condition=\"instance\">Associate <b ng-non-bindable=''>${ instance_name }</b> with an elastic IP address.</p>\r\n            <p i18n:translate=\"\" tal:condition=\"not instance\">Associate <b>{{ instanceName }}</b> with an elastic IP address.</p>\r\n\r\n\"landingpage\" is a boolean passed in based on where the dialog is called from. Seems fair. In the 2nd case, there is a condition based on if \"instance\" is defined at the time, so that basically detects if instance is defined when the server side construction of the dialog is done. Fair enough.\r\n\r\nThe approach I took was to assume everything used angular, so the controller always ensures the scope has values that are needed by the dialog so the template would use the {{ instanceID }} markup and that value would be in the controller scope. In the case of the landing page, a method called to display the dialog would accept the \"item\" and do this;\r\n   $scope.instanceID = item['id'];\r\nIn the single view page, that value could be passed into the controller init method which would do;\r\n   $scope.instanceID = instanceID;\r\n\r\nIMHO, the later allows the dialog templates to be simpler and easier to read. There aren't any conditional bits based on where it is used from. The complexity is pushed to the controller which is different for each type of page anyway. The controller has the responsibility of putting values in the scope. The controller init method can take any number of values from objects as well as routes.\r\nI think the reason I used the later approach was because I was doing a lot of XHR calls and so there usually wasn't a form in the dialog that was being submitted normally, rather a ng-submit was there to handle it using $html in the controller.\r\nThe form action can be set in the controller before showing the modal, so that's an option as well.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?? If we're moving towards more XHR post 4.0, we should consider standardizing on some approach for this to get max re-use on all of the code.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n\r\nPS. I have also seen 2 routes for the same operation based on where it is called from, so we get (for example) 2 ways to terminate an instance. I know the main reason is because the redirect after the action is different. With XHR calls, I could always use a single route to perform a function (must better REST semantics). \r\n","customfield_13000":null,"customfield_13200":null,"customfield_11300":null,"customfield_11500":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_10401":null,"customfield_10005":null,"customfield_10600":null,"customfield_12900":null,"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"attachment":[],"summary":"Standardize re-usable UI on Angularjs","creator":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"reporter":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=dkavanagh","name":"dkavanagh","key":"dkavanagh","accountId":"557058:03be2b52-89f7-4c8f-8e00-e2a60a3e7a5e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/e04f1add3c50bf8a7d1676b60b8ba337?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Ddkavanagh%26avatarId%3D10202%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"David Kavanagh","active":false,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12100":"0|i02lmv:","customfield_10000":"5_*:*_1_*:*_0_*|*_10000_*:*_1_*:*_1965661_*|*_10001_*:*_1_*:*_40788835071","aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_10001":"2015-07-13T14:06:02.773-0500","customfield_10200":null,"customfield_10002":null,"customfield_10003":null,"customfield_12500":null,"customfield_10400":null,"customfield_11600":["dkavanagh(dkavanagh)","kgill(kgill)"],"customfield_10116":null,"environment":null,"customfield_10117":null,"customfield_11800":null,"customfield_11802":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_11805":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_11806":null,"votes":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/GUI-661/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/28510/comment/89235","id":"89235","author":{"self":"https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/user?username=kgill","name":"kgill","key":"kgill","accountId":"557058:d51f06c5-6e24-45a0-83f2-493f2c8eac6e","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=48&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3FownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","24x24":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=24&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","16x16":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=16&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dxsmall%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue","32x32":"https://avatar-cdn.atlassian.com/8ed235fc95ad0f38552ce9617bdbf985?s=32&d=https%3A%2F%2Feucalyptus.atlassian.net%2Fsecure%2Fuseravatar%3Fsize%3Dmedium%26ownerId%3Dkgill%26avatarId%3D18200%26noRedirect%3Dtrue"},"displayName":"Kamal Gill","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Closing due to overly-vague wording.
