There are also several options for doing this:\r\n\r\n1) redirect to landing page on save changes. This is not ideal because some detail pages (like IAM users), an admin might want to do multiple things there and auto-redirecting to the landing page would be a bummer. DO NOT WANT\r\n2) make all success growls persistent, and user has to manually dismiss them. This can be annoying for users, and if they need to see what they have been up to they should be able to do that soon with the option to view recent actions DO NOT WANT\r\n3) pop up a modal on save changes that says basically, \"your changes have been saved. are you done here? with two buttons \"Yes, take me back tot he landing page\" and \"no, i'm still editing this resource\" to determine if redirect is needed. This should include a \"don't show me this again\" checkbox. That checkboxes value should be saved on a resource-by-resource basis, so that I may say i always want to be redirected to the landing page when i save changes for an instance, i always want to stay here on the detail page for IAM users, and for IAM groups i left the checkbox unchecked so please ask me again next time. Probably not ideal in light of #4 or #5. more work, more potential for complexity and nastiness. \r\n4) have two \"save changes\" type buttons, one that is \"save and continue editing\" and the other is \"save and close\" This is the recommended path! (it's also a potential way to fix the issue with the create scaling group checkbox on the launch config wizard.) \r\n5) like #4, but the option to continue editing or close would be contained within a checkbox and there would be one save button. Advantage of checkbox state being persistent and only having one button. OK, but not as elegante as #4. Could do A/B testing between this option and option 4, see what users prefer. \r\n6) Do nothing. Not the most user friendly.\r\n\r\nT SHIRT SIZE SMALL FOR EITHER OPTION 4 or
